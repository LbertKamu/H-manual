## Loop of happiness and sadness.

Most of my early youth, I was aware of this loop, that I am  stuck in the cycle of this loop of happiness and sadness. 
I knew that If I am sad, I will become happy.
And If I am happy, then the sadness is somewhere looking for me.

I didn't knew what to do with this information, with this loop. So, I did what any writer do. I wrote a character around it. A traffic police women who likes to live around people who are suffering, because she knew that nothing can hurt her because she is living in suffering and chaos. If she is happy, she would become anxious. I dumped this story, But I think I should fix it, and publish it.

Until recently, When I lost my pet. I realized that the things that makes me happy are the reason that makes me sad.

I cherish the day I bought my first pet, out of my own earned money. I was happy and I was feeling so many emotions that day.

And when my pet died few days back, it was equally painful for me.

So, I knew the loop of happiness and sadness, but when I realized that The source of happiness and sadness is same. Everything is changed.

I saw my friend buying a car with his money, he was on cloud ten and Everyone was appreciating him, until a labour carrying his stuff scratched his car. He flipped, anxiety took over him, anger took over him, fear took over him. He was sad about the scratch.
And I watched like, I have found the glitch in a matrix. 

I bought the iphone, I was happy and with in a month  I dropped it and the screen was shattered into pieces, My soul left my body and returned with a silent scream.
