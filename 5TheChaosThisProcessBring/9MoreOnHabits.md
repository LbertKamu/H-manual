I need to talk about the habits a bit more, because Its not easy to break free from them.
# Why?

Because, habits are there to keep us sane from the loops of Happiness and sadness, Desire and dis-satisfaction.

So we know that we need to begin from the habits to get to the part where only memories exist as a process.

Habits are there every day with us, every habit itself is a loop that you need to break. Lets say a simple one: Can you not watch mobile,tv,or anything when you are eating a meal. Can you shit without using instagram or twitter or reddit.
We can't but we have bad habits we want to break,but we can't. Staying healthy is a sport now days and we lose at it everyday. Eating clean which was a goto life fifty years back is now a desire where we see ourself happy.

We can't break out of these bad habits because everyday we do it. so, we get attached to them and we get dependent on them.

because we are attached and dependent on it. When the boredom or loneliness comes, we run to these habits.

So, to break habits we need to face the gaps between them. Try to resist what habit you want to rid of, and see in that resistance what made you pursue it. but if you feel bad, that why you can't quit, and you loath yourself. It wont work. 

The only think that will work is you see that you fail another hundred time but this time you are watching, what made you flip. you are not loathing yourself. you are watching. you are looking for the cause or the source which made your brain pursue habits.

This is what intelligence is, when you realize how this memory of yours function and these loops of suffering springs from it, life become effortless.
