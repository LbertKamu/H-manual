We deal with uncertain life, by grabbing on to the pleasures it gives us and we forget that life is uncertain. As it gave pleasure, It will give pain also.

This above text feels like divine intervention, that we need to follow and see.

One fact is that, life is uncertain and new every moment, When one gets out of the loop.

1. The loop of happiness and sadness. If you are happy, the sadness will come. If you are sad, the happiness will come.
But when you see that the source of happiness and sadness is same. things will change. The moment you choose something that will make you happy, on that moment that choice is bound to make you sad, maybe not today but tomorrow.

Another truth I discovered that if one is sad or suffering its not a problem to be solved, but that sadness and suffering is the consequences of a choice you made in the past.
As I said, We can not solve the human problems like we solve a math problem.
Our solution is in the cause of the problem.
Either you remove the cause. Or accept the truth that you can't do anything about the cause, and most of the time you could do something about it, but we don't because we look for the solution of the problem not the cause of it.

When we begun to see the cause of the problem, you can do so many things about it.

## Desire and Dissatisfaction:
You are walking on a street and you saw a women, as beautiful as an angel and you desire her, thats natural.

Desire is natural. As we talked about, its a natural process of thinking. Which is Pattern matching, comparing, anticipating and desire.

You saw a women and you pattern match and compared it with your data and found out that she is beautiful. 
(You might find lady gaga a beauty, but for me its jennifer laurence, why, because the data related to beauty is different for me and different for you that's why what I find beautiful you might find ugly)
You imagine yourself kissing her, or flirting with her, you anticipated, and desire is formed that you want her.

same thing happened with the coffee, or a tea or a cigarette, you desired and you drank or smoked because you could.
You can desire a women from a street, desire is beautiful but you can't act on it because, its inappropriate. If its not, we hear the news all the time, what compulsive men do.

Desire is not real, desire means what you don't have or what you are going to do. You desire, then only you raise your had. you can't raise your hand if you don't desire first.
Its crucial. 
But when desire comes in where its not needed, it creates problems.
for example, you saw stadium full of people cheering for a man. You desire to be there, and you spent years of you life but you failed. you are dis-satisfied. and to fill that dis-satisfaction, you indulge in many pleasurable situation like smoking, numbing yourself by drinking. Or spending money on prostitution.

The thing you desire are the reason for your dis-satisfaction.
The source of a beautiful desire and dis-satisfaction is same.

So, the source of happiness and sadness is same.
The source of desire and dis-satisfaction is same.
