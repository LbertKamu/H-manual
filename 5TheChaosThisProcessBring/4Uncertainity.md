Uncertainty is so overwhelming that we take solace in the past, meaning solace in our memories and we want the memories to come into the future.
For example:-
You loved to write and you want to be a writer in future.
You liked this girl and you want her as a wife in future.

We want the comforts of today for the future because this comfort feels right in this uncertain world, and we want to carry it with us every moment, because life is uncertain at every moment. 

In this uncertainty which exist at every moment, we find comfort in things and we try to carry it always, forgetting that this comfort came from uncertainty and the discomfort will also come from this uncertainty, but for some reason we are attached to the pleasure that comes from uncertainty but we avoid pain that comes form uncertainty.

When we accept that uncertainty is the only truth, then every pleasure that comes from it will feel special, we carry this pleasure, beat the shit out of it and exhaust it and in return it makes our life dull.

But if you  are a conscious being who see that uncertainty is the only reality and when it gives pleasure you enjoy it and when it gives pain you accept it, as you accepted pleasure.

For example, suppose someone ask you to go to watch a cricket match because he has extra ticket, if you want you can go and take the pleasure of watching a cricket match, you watch it. Now, you are sitting in the stadium with your friend, you both are excited. but it rains, and the match get postpone. You are still fine because you see that everything is uncertain, not because I say so, and you follow this rule that life is uncertain. **You see for yourself that life is uncertain and our attempt to control it makes us suffer.**
Your friend is suffering in the rain almost crying, he had a bad week at office and the pain of contempt led him to this cricket match, but now the rain happened, he is even more sad and he is suffering.

But you on the other hand is naturally joyful, the rain in this stadium feels unique, you look at people reacting, crying, enjoying, sneezing. You are fine, this stadium is fine, the music, the crowd, the murmur. I haven't been to a cricket match myself, but I feel these things might happen.

But why your friend is suffering and not you, you must have figured out something that made you joyous. 

Life is uncertain. What made you see that. Let me point it out for you.
