The loop of duality.
1. someone said that we can feel we are alive because we have ups and downs in our life, cheer it. flat line belongs to a dead person.
2. Another man phrased it as and i quote "to live is to suffer and to survive is to find meaning in that suffereing"

 what is a loop, its a circle of death. we are going round and round, stuck into a pattern and one of larger one is the loop of happiness and sadness, the loop of avoiding pain and chasing pleasure. The loop of i like this and i dislike that.
 
 See it in your daily life, we want to control the day but the day is as alive as you are and it has its own momentum and you have to confront that you have no other option. 
 For eg. you choose to rest for the day, you switch off your phone and was planing to sit on your bed and watch movie or sleep or play games. Now, if this will happen or not depend on the day and situation you are in, maybe today your mother need groceries, you relative brother is looking for a college and you have to find it for him, or your girlfriend wants to go out for shopping, or you might get sick because of the food you eat last night, or you wake up with a sharp pain that wont go away and you have to visit the doctor. You can't help it, you have to confront the day now matter what you want with the day. 
 
 "as i was writing this something happende: its winter, and the sun was warm and my mother was cutting the frutis for herself and she thought she should ask me. She screamed from the other room that if i want the fruits, and if yes then ask your brother if he also wants the same."
 I screamd back, that i was writng.
 she said, so, you want it or not, and did you ask you brother if he wants the fruits.
 The momentem was lost so, i choose to take the laptop to her and eat the fruit. I asked my brother if he wants the fruits, he was in a meeting so i left him alone. and i am typing this as i am eating the fruits. 
 you see the day is as alive as me. But if you watch the day closely you will see patterns and a recurring situations you face daily and you can shape the day according to your need.
 I could have said that i am writing dont disturb me. but i am fine with it. I don't care about the interuption because i can write this book anywhere i want, and anytime i want. my likes and dislikes dont bother me much. they are there but on my terms.(fix this text to vague)
 ## Your every day have friction because:
 Becasue the day went by according to your happiness and you likes.
 lets say: you wake up. and you get to know that your mother prepared your favorite food.(likes). you become happy. you took a bath and and suddenly its raining and your father asked you to skip school because the news says the the weather is going to get worse. You don't like to go to school and today you don't have to go. you are on cloud seven and you have experienced the peak of happiness. Now you have all the time to complete your homework and play games. you did your homework and slept for few hours before eating your favorite meal, as soon as you wake up you mouth start to water, as you are thinking about your favorite food. You eat and play game and at night you sleep with a smile wishing all the days should be like this.
 If the day treats you as a king you are happy. and if it does'nt it makes us miserible.
 
 we struggle everyday because our happinesss depend upon when something happens the way we like and sadeness depend upon when something hapens that we dont like.
 we make the rules and suffer it. rule one: no one should disturb you when you are writing. and when someone disturbes you, you go crazy. Here [watch this](https://youtu.be/SPSHHR-YueM?t=119).
