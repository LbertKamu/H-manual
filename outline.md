# Human Manual:
``` How does a human being function, and knowing that can we change what we are.``` ``````

## 1. Introduction.---
we can be what we are allowed, No matter what rule we follow, if we are suffering there is some problem with the system that we are following. ```The text explores the nature of human existence, emphasizing that we are born as blank slates without predetermined identities or purposes. It discusses the emergence of consciousness as an accidental phenomenon, leading to existential questions about creation and meaning. Despite advancements in society, the author highlights a pervasive sense of suffering and disillusionment in modern life, criticizing the flawed systems that shape our beliefs and experiences. Ultimately, it encourages individuals to recognize their inherent potential for self-discovery and to reject negative conditioning in order to find personal meaning and clarity in their lives.```

## 2. conclusion vs truth...
people can have different conclusion but they cant have different truth. Truth stays the same, it is not dependent on the existence of an individual.```The text distinguishes between conclusion and truth. Conclusions are subjective and vary based on individual experiences, while truth is objective and exists independently of personal beliefs. It illustrates these concepts through examples: the discovery of mathematical truths, such as the relationship between the circumference and diameter of a circle (pi), which are universal and unchanging, versus the personal conclusion of Gendun Chophel, a Tibetan monk who equated sensory experiences like sex and alcohol with divinity. The narrative emphasizes the significance of observation in uncovering universal truths about human existence while acknowledging that personal interpretations can differ widely.```

## 3. Introduce yourself.....
they ask you in school and you dont had the answer so you prepared at home, a fake introduction. you searched the google or asked your intelligent friend. what are you.```The text explores how our identities shift based on social contexts, highlighting the anxiety of self-introduction and the different personas we adopt with family, friends, and colleagues. It argues that our personalities are shaped by our likes, dislikes, and cultural influences, which evolve over time.
The author identifies common life goals—happiness, health, beauty, fulfillment, and enlightenment—and suggests that everyone is at different stages in the "marathon of life," with many struggling to keep up. The concept of a "free personality" is introduced, where individuals can adapt effortlessly to situations without fixed preferences. The text aims to guide readers toward understanding human functioning and achieving greater freedom in their identities in the upcoming chapters.```

## Experience and senses.

## 4.  pain and pleasure.
A basic human function is, pain and pleasure. you avoid pain and go toward pleasure. thats it.

## 4.1. happiness and sadness.
The eternal cycle of happiness and sadness. one can escape it.

## 5.Your ambition is also a pleasure.
ambition is the ultimate pleasure, you think that.

## 6. Are you a pet.
there is a worse kind of conditening. that you are a pet of a society or your parents. you have no desire, no ambition, and no purpose of life. you are only seeking love from your parents and respect from your society. They made you that way. your parents showed affection only if you did something they liked. like getting good marks, they love you, you go to a temple , they love you, you getup early and greet them they love you, you get married to their choice of guy or girl, they love you, you get promotion they love you, you have a higher package they love you. and if you are this you know what you have to do. but if you are changed anything a bit, these loving bastards show you their cruel side when you go against them, looking fo someting that you want to do. unless you do what they asked you to do, everything is fine. same with the society, if you try to be something different, they thrash you. if this is you, i dont think this book is for you because. you are in the future going to discover yourself, and will get to chase your pleasures. then you will need this book. to rid yourself of the burden of desire. this is the last chapter.
## 7.  no fix place. *** negative conclusions.*** needs a full chapter.----from now own i will not make conclusion. ect. ect.

## 8. u can not live without conclusion, but knowing that is all you need to know, people change all the time and forming a conclusion about anyone is stupit, but you are a studet, and there is a guy who is bully, and you talk to him just becase you are trying hard to not forming conclusion that the bully is really not bully, you stay away knowing he can change, but for now he is a bully but in future if i see him i wont run away just because today he is a bully. ect...ect....!


## 9.There is a thin line between conclusion and trut, and onlyway to check it is the truth. you see the truth that is reveled itself creates the problem or solves it .
