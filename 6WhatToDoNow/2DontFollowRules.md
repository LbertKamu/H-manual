## Don't follow rules. Its exhausting!

Rules are created by people who are there where you want to be so naturally you are inclined to follow the rules.
One thing to observe is that they could make the rules for you because, they experimented with life and they failed and they learned until they realize. Now you come and ask, sir how did you do it. He will tell you the rule that he discovered for himself.

For example: I always wanted to loose weight and the only advice I got, or I searched was to go for a run, eat 100gm protein and this much carbs , control your craving and so on so on. I did and failed, I was so desperate that I ate chicken even when we as a family don't eat onion and garlic.

I am still fat but I myself by trial and error got to a point where its effortless for me to do this.

I discovered the same thing and if you ask me for quick advice, I might give you what other gave me.

But, when I think back now. I wanted them to tell me that. I mean its obvious that I am shying to share it, that You calculate how much calories your body need. I guess Its called. BMI. and If i want to loose weight, I have to eat 1800 calories.

And I was eating more then 3000calories. Just a 20rupees chocolate had 500 calories.
What I did was I made myself veg food for the whole day just to test. And I couldn't get past 1200 calories. Because 1200calories of clean home cooked meal was like I am eating a meal for two days.

I eat way less calories and felt full, and before I ate 3000 calories yet I was hungry, thinking I am loosing weight.

1200 clean calories is heavier then 3000 of junk food. 
And today after four days I was able to eat 1800 calories. then I discovered that I need to drink 2.5 liter to let all the protein convert easily. otherwise you will have shit problems. and because you are taking this much protein, you need to take veggies for the fiber for better digestion. 

Its revelation after revelation, the chain will begun when you observe and then figure out for yourself. 

Now, what I wrote here, I wanted someone to wrote for me, so it would be easy for me to work at if quickly. 

So, Don't through rules at me, point out what you discovered and How can I. Thats it.

Thats why I say avoid reading quotes, because they are the juice of someone's five years of life. 

When someone try to put a rule on you, you ask him or her how you discovered that rule.
If he says heard it from someone, smile and move away.
But if he tells you, how he discovered it, because he tried this and failed and he found out that this the the best way or its the only way.

I had a friend who said once, when I was not interested in loosing weight, that he wasted a year because he used to run for building muscle, he used to run 10 km every day, instead of building muscle he loosed it because, He ran, He used to strength  train also, but when he quit running and only did strength training, it only took him only six months to get the shape he wanted.

If you ask him for advice, and he is not into teaching, he might say that do strength training, and eat clean. you will get where you want to be, but because you don't realize what he had realized. You might run because most of us don't want to go to the gym,  we run or jog not knowing that its not strength training.

But if he tell you, what he discovered the hard way, that running will hinder your muscle progress and he will tell you his story of how he discovered. Its good for you because now, you don't have to take a year to check is right or not. If you believe him, it will be fine for you.
but if he say, don't run just do strength training. and you ask why. and he says, because thats how it is an he doesn't have an answer. He might have a body you want to have, but his understanding is nothing.
Thats why don't follow rules. Discover them, by yourself or take any help you can.

It applies on everything that a human can do. Just don't follow rules discover them yourself.

I have pointed out many things so that you can discover them yourself. Don't trust me, just read and see what I am pointing out and try to see if what I am saying is true or false.
