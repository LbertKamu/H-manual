Sit for 20 minutes.

Another thing you can do to discover things about you is, you decide a time and sit for 20 minutes, where thinking is also not allowed. 

You say to yourself that for the next 20 minutes nothing matters so I wont even think, I will sit blank.

Now, see what thoughts come even though you said that you won't think.
and what are the things you want to do in those 20 minutes even though you said you will sit blank.

Don't judge yourself, don't loath yourself and don't panic because You are just checking or testing the depth of the shit you are in.

collect data, sit for ten days. See what thought, images are repeating. See the cause of the repeated things.

It will begin your journey in knowing yourself.
