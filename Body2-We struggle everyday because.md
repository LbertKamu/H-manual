## Your every day have friction because:
 Becasue the day went by according to your happiness and you likes.
 lets say: you wake up. and you get to know that your mother prepared your favorite food.(likes). you become happy. you took a bath and and suddenly its raining and your father asked you to skip school because the news says the the weather is going to get worse. You don't like to go to school and today you don't have to go. you are on cloud seven and you have experienced the peak of happiness. Now you have all the time to complete your homework and play games. you did your homework and slept for few hours before eating your favorite meal, as soon as you wake up you mouth start to water, as you are thinking about your favorite food. You eat and play game and at night you sleep with a smile wishing all the days should be like this.
 If the day treats you as a king you are happy. and if it does'nt it makes us miserible. 
 when the list of things that we like happens its a wonderfull day and if the list of thing we dislike happens we are miserable.
 ## Then we have to ask what are these likes and dislikes come into being. Right.
 
 Remember the early chapter how pleasing any of your five senses gives you plesure and displeasing any of your senses gives you discomfort. When something is plesasing to your senses happens you record it automatically, lets take a common example.
 ### One of the likes. 
 The smell of sand when its raining it somehow pleases your sense of smell. You remember it right. how calming it is, you feel good, you make coffee or tea to churn up the experience further. its a pleasure you like it when it happens. (add hermonie scene of smelling potion)
 
 ### One of our dislikes.
 Then on the other hand pain, oh we like to avoid that no matter the strength of pain we avoid it, as elon musk says" you say you want to be like me, whats your pain threshold" How good are you at managing your pain.
 pain can come from the same pleasurable situation because it depends on the displeasing of the senses. maybe you were enjoying that smell of that first rain when your grandma dies and to save her, your whole family was stuck in the traffic as the grandma is lying in the back seat with you comforting her head and the rain is heavy suddenly everything is melencholic and you are going through some extreme emotions and somehow the day was passed. Now, every time you smell the rain, your being goes into terror thinking about the same day and you try to avoide that smell because now you cant smell that, it makes you feel bad.
 **So, what is a good experience for you can be a bad for someone else. so, pleasure and pain depends upon the pleasing and displeasing of our senses and pleasing and displeasing depends on the situation we are facing.** 

 
 ## displeasing really doesent exist if you think about it.
 it's the unknown that hurts, ones you are comfortable with unknown everything will make sense. Let me show you.
 ## security and insecurity:
 we are secure in our daily life (explain how) and when the bubble of security bursts we left with displeasing mind who thought it had security. But there is no security(explain-we can die at anytime). 
 
 
 For example when you are partying for days and then suddenly nothing happens and you are alone with yourself, you feel lonely and some feeling of dissatisfaction comes about and you want to feel fulfilled and then there is the desire of the pleasure of fulfilment. When whole day you indulge in pleasure, pelasure after pleasure. what you are left with is boredom, lonelyness and anxiety, when you quit anykind of drug there is anxiety, its same with pleasure, when its not there there is anxiety tere is sadness, and so on so on. you feel lonely because you dont have a relationship with anyone else. and you feel lonely in the crowd because you dont have the kind of relationship you used to had.
 we struggle everyday because our happinesss depend upon when something happens the way we like and sadeness depend upon when something hapens that we dont like.
 we make the rules and suffer it. rule one: no one should disturb you when you are writing. and when someone disturbes you, you go crazy. Here [watch this](https://youtu.be/SPSHHR-YueM?t=119).
