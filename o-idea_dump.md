## The loop of duality.
1. someone said that we can feel we are alive because we have ups and downs in our life, cheer it. flat line belongs to a dead person.
2. Another man phrased it as and i quote "to live is to suffer and to survive is to find meaning in that suffereing"
these two implies that one should exist in the loop of happiness and sadness. you feel happy because you were sad, and you become sad because you were happy. and this loop end with our death.

 Loop is a circle of death. we are going round and round, stuck into a pattern and one of larger one is the loop of happiness and sadness, the loop of avoiding pain and chasing pleasure. The loop of i like this and i dislike that.
 
 

## So, what do we want?
If something happens the way we want we are happy other wise we are sad. Then what is this `want` we are , thing actually, happiness and fulfilment. Happiness and fulfilment are related friends, happiness is something that you get when everthing goes the way you wanted but fulfilment on the other hand is a state where everyday to the end of you life you are happy and satisfid. (holy shit i have a new idea for a movie, what if somehow a character is put into a situation where ther are always happy and they get bored of happiness. 60s bollywood happy life, with the reality of his prison life.) lets look at the second point, when we say we are totally fulfilled and satisfied. Do we mean that, we got everything that we ever wanted, the girl you liked is your wife now, you wanted to travel into space and now you have a space company, you eat fast food, pizza burger, cheese, and all the fatty stuff and you still are healthy, and have six packs, you are the richest person in the world that elon musk is your driver and yet you are able to sleep twelve hours a day. you are running ten sucessfull company yet you are on vacation most of the year travelling the world. You liked another girl and now she is your second wife, for you specially god has send his angles as your maid. for you god has made you imortal and now you can live forever and has babies more the gengis khan could ever produce.

You see the problem, your want has nothing to do with the reaity, what you read above is an adult unemployed male dreaming in the afternoon as he lay listening to a motivationl vidoes on youtube. 

`We want someting because we think that getting what we want will give us happines and fulfillment. We dont want that a random stranger should get the girl you like. you want that girl for yourself because you think that she can provide what you want, her existence in your life will solve all your problem, you are going to have sex with her, you are going to protect her and ect..ect..
and just thinking about it give you pleasure, and you wonder if she really be with you, the world will be perfect for you. yet we see people breaking up. because what they imagined was not true, in reality she doesn't need a man to protect her, and it hurts your ego and you desire to protect her, you are unhappy, She calls you pervert, because all you want is sex, and it made you insecure and your sense of self is hurt, you are unhappy because you are not having the amount of sex you thought you could be doing. see this [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiadiscussion/comments/1hlceuu/lmao_when_prn_sites_replies_are_more_sensible/#lightbox) post. you start a startup but no-one sees the value in your product, and you are sad, right. you are sad because you iamgined that you will run the startup and it will be bigger then facebook, and then you will also write on your buisness card that "I am ceo bitch" but no one is seeing any value in your startup and it is dying and you are sad, but if you knew and you were practical about the things you can manifest in this world then the story is different. To run a company like space x, you need to sell a company like paypal. you go step by step, faliur after faliur when finally you get what you want because you really worked for it. what we want has nothing to with reality we are living in. yet we want becasue we think it will fulfill us and give us the satisfaction we needed to be happy.

## COLLECTING PLEASURE:
look at you life and see if you are anything other then the person who collects pleasure. look at your day from the moment you wake up to the moment you sleep. when you are consumed in pleasure you are ok, but as soon as something which is not pleasure happens you get crazy and you need another pleasure to fill that.
 

 The loop of duality:
 1. if something happens that you like you are happy. This is pleasure: which in clude all the good sensations and good feelings.
 2. when something happens that you dont like you are sad. this is pain: which include all the discomfort and painfull feeling. which include, sadness, loneliness, boredome, jealousy, envy and so on so on.
 3. naturally we avoid discomfort and run towards the things we like. we chase the pleasure.
 4. example of discomfort that is common for everyone: slap, fever: you are filled with thoughts.
 5. What is discomfort, what is pain, we need to undersatand that because we welcome pleasure.but becasue of pleasure the pain exist. Break the loop and live the fulfilled life you always wanted.
 6. because of pleasure their is pain and because their is pain we are ambitious and we think that acheaving the things we want will fulfil us and fix everything in our life. but people who are where they wanted to be are not fulfilled, the desire to fulfil stays with them till the day they die.
 7. problem with pleasure is that it exhaust over time. because pleasure is not alive and you experiece it in the past. fruit example.
 8. something this is pleasing to your senses right now doesnt mean it will be the same always.
 9. you dont deny pleasure, you just see clearly that the pleasure is happening because of the circumtancces. Same situation that is giving you pleasure right now might left you displeasing in the future. 
 10. pleasure is good when its happening, after that it has no significance. Dont take it with you and compare it with everytime you face the same situation again.
 11. The masterbation to sex story. thank god that we age and as we age we are less sexually aroused.
 12. break the loop of duality and become free, then you will live in the present.





 ## Your every day have friction because:
 Becasue the day went by according to your happiness and you likes.
 lets say: you wake up. and you get to know that your mother prepared your favorite food.(likes). you become happy. you took a bath and and suddenly its raining and your father asked you to skip school because the news says the the weather is going to get worse. You don't like to go to school and today you don't have to go. you are on cloud seven and you have experienced the peak of happiness. Now you have all the time to complete your homework and play games. you did your homework and slept for few hours before eating your favorite meal, as soon as you wake up you mouth start to water, as you are thinking about your favorite food. You eat and play game and at night you sleep with a smile wishing all the days should be like this.
 If the day treats you as a king you are happy. and if it does'nt it makes us miserible. 
 when the list of things that we like happens its a wonderfull day and if the list of thing we dislike happens we are miserable.
 ## Then we have to ask what are these likes and dislikes come into being. Right.
 
 Remember the early chapter how pleasing any of your five senses gives you plesure and displeasing any of your senses gives you discomfort. When something is plesasing to your senses happens you record it automatically, lets take a common example.
 ### One of the likes. 
 The smell of sand when its raining it somehow pleases your sense of smell. You remember it right. how calming it is, you feel good, you make coffee or tea to churn up the experience further. its a pleasure you like it when it happens. (add hermonie scene of smelling potion)
 
 ### One of our dislikes.
 Then on the other hand pain, oh we like to avoid that no matter the strength of pain we avoid it, as elon musk says" you say you want to be like me, whats your pain threshold" How good are you at managing your pain.
 pain can come from the same pleasurable situation because it depends on the displeasing of the senses. maybe you were enjoying that smell of that first rain when your grandma dies and to save her, your whole family was stuck in the traffic as the grandma is lying in the back seat with you comforting her head and the rain is heavy suddenly everything is melencholic and you are going through some extreme emotions and somehow the day was passed. Now, every time you smell the rain, your being goes into terror thinking about the same day and you try to avoide that smell because now you cant smell that, it makes you feel bad.
 **So, what is a good experience for you can be a bad for someone else. so, pleasure and pain depends upon the pleasing and displeasing of our senses and pleasing and displeasing depends on the situation we are facing.** 

 
 ## displeasing really doesent exist if you think about it.
 it's the unknown that hurts, ones you are comfortable with unknown everything will make sense. Let me show you.
 ## security and insecurity:
 we are secure in our daily life (explain how) and when the bubble of security bursts we left with displeasing mind who thought it had security. But there is no security(explain-we can die at anytime). 
 
 
 For example when you are partying for days and then suddenly nothing happens and you are alone with yourself, you feel lonely and some feeling of dissatisfaction comes about and you want to feel fulfilled and then there is the desire of the pleasure of fulfilment. When whole day you indulge in pleasure, pelasure after pleasure. what you are left with is boredom, lonelyness and anxiety, when you quit anykind of drug there is anxiety, its same with pleasure, when its not there there is anxiety tere is sadness, and so on so on. you feel lonely because you dont have a relationship with anyone else. and you feel lonely in the crowd because you dont have the kind of relationship you used to had.
 we struggle everyday because our happinesss depend upon when something happens the way we like and sadeness depend upon when something hapens that we dont like.
 we make the rules and suffer it. rule one: no one should disturb you when you are writing. and when someone disturbes you, you go crazy. Here [watch this](https://youtu.be/SPSHHR-YueM?t=119).
 examples.
 
 universal mother in law and daughterinlaw struggle.
 both have dreams.
 



 Conditioning example: I love it so much that I want to keep it for myself.
 you cage your animals, and their is a large market for it. You see a dog and made you feel good about
