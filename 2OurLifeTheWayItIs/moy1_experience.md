## On Experience:
lets begin from the top. The day we are born.
As we pop out into the world; First thing that happen to us, is we experience the existence. You are in a hospital hearing all the beeps from the monitors. Hearing alien native words, eyes squint from the gleaming tube light, Electric buzz in the wires and the warmth of our mother's comforting voice, everything we experience we experience for the first time. So, Experience is the first thing we should talk about. Lets jump right in.

### What is experience?
We are born with five senses. That is taste, smell, touch, sound, and seeing. These are common among every one of us. Now, Experience happen through these god given senses. 
* Anything that is displeasing to our senses is a bad experiences for eg. Someone screaming(sound), silent farts(smell), awkward hugs(touch), domino's pizza(taste), seeing wet shit under the toilet lid in a public bathroom(seeing).

* Anything pleasing to our senses is a good experience. For eg, Sex(touch), fruit juice(taste), aromas(smell), good music(sound),looking at your naked girlfriend(seeing).

Our life revolve around satisfying these senses because when something satisfy our senses it gifts us with a feeling of pleasure, you know pleasure right, tingling in the heart, the vibrant sensation, that outburst of energy, when you feel like you are the king, when you suddenly starts to sing, when your mouth starts to water seeing the waitress bringing you your pizza. Yes, that wholesome feeling. 
 When something dis-satisfy our senses it makes everything dull and painful for us, and we avoid this dulness all our life. Dulness can be many things and its a safe word, because its much worse in experience. You should see for yourself what happens when something displeases your senses, first we run towards safe pleasures to avoid these feelings that comes when something displeases your senses, and I am dead sure you don't know what is the feeling that happens when something displeases your senses because we collectively avoid them by the instant pleasures. Some might smoke, some might jerk off, some might doom scroll on the social media, or watch a comfort movie. anything to avoid that dreadful feeling.

so, experience is the product of the input that is given to your five senses, and to gather experience all you have to do is live, and by living different type of situations your body and mind will decides what kind of experience you have.

For example: Someone sneezes, we say bless you. During corona, someone sneezed and we say fuck you, pull your mask up or fucking stay in the house.
See, different type of situation makes a experience bad or good.
Another example, a girl of your liking, kissing you is a pleasing experience, but a bummer from the street kisses you and run is a traumatic experience or bad experience.
> Now, we know that our experience is based on the situation we are encountering. Depending upon how the situation interacts with our senses we collect bad and good experiences that we call memories. If it feels good then, its a good experience. If it feels bad its a bad experience.

So, when every experience depends on how it made us feel, then we need to talk about. Feelings. In other words, what is pleasure and what is pain. What is happiness and what is sadness. What are these situations(inputs) that we get from life while living that make us feel good and bad. thats the next chapter. I know this is basic but stay with this, its important.
