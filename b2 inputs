Inputs are the things that we cant control, but it is still in the realm of pleasing
and displeading---- inputs are the things that that can make a pleasureble situation into painful situation, and painful situation into a pleasure one.
Inputs is the real life you are living. for say you like coffee. and now you are out and you see a coffee shop and you order one and its shit. the xperience is bad even though you thought you like coffee. its a bad experience, 

thats why they say when life give you lemon you make a lemonade and drink up.

inputs are also like and dislikes, inputs is the day you face, nomatter what your likes and dislikes are, the day will challange you, you love coffee, the day might feed you a shitty coffee to ruin you, you love travelling, the day might through into a situation that can make your traveling situation worse, for example you are in a jungle with no signal and you forget your music at home now you have to face the silence in the jungle, or you encounter the animal, or you slip from somewhere, you love traveling.
Input is the day challanging and playing with your like and dislikes, you might dislike to visit a relative but your parents force you to visit and you go there sulking but soon, you discover that you relatives have put up a beautifull girl as a tenet and now, all you want to do is hangout with her, and she is also friendly. I made your day. You might hate the result day but you get good percentage and you are happy. 
The day challenge you, and your struggle to accept the challange makes you miserable.
