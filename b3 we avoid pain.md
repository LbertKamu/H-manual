Now, lets make a little diagram, to understand something.

We Take inputs through our senses|--if the input is displeasing then its pain. 
                                    if the input is pleasing then its pleasure.

So, logically we will want pleasure not pain, Because pleasure feels good and pain is worse.

Now, looking at this we can say that we are in a loop, because one appreciate the other. `Because there is pain we learn the value of pleasure in life`
Because one is sad, the value of happiness grows 100 folds, right. 

Lets imagine a scenario, where you are happy and happy and happy, after a while you will get bored right, to much of anything and its ruined.

You like cake but if you have to eat only cake through out your life, it can be a traumatic experience.

So, we know for a fact that to-much of anything is exhausting. sleep is good for health, but you try to sleep for long it make you feel more tired and groggy.

Thats why potato chips have the mix of everything the spices, the bitter the salty, the sweet and the crunchy and the aromas, its made to make you feel stimulated. It based on this same formula that to much of anything is exhausting and boring, we should mix things up, a life is exciting if its unpredictable and have many ups and down.

A machine that shows up's and down's means the man is alive, but a flat line with a long beep belongs to a dead person.

Being alive right now means you are facing ups and downs like heart beat, it beats because it dips.
So, like your own heartbeat, you are also facing ups and downs, you beat when you are happy and you dip when you are sad. you beat when something you like happens, you dip when something you dislike happens. you beat when something you want happens you dip when something you want doesn't happen. 

This is the life we are used to and see around us, and it makes absolutely sense, but if you look closely at this. you will get some answers about your suffering.

## We want to avoid pain.

Any kind of pain is uncomfortable, and because its uncomfortable we avoid it as soon as we can, you touch a hot stove, before you can even sense what the burning sensation feels like you will pull back you finger.

But let me give you two very good examples that we share commonly and I feel joy because it took me a lot of exploring to find these two example that is so common among us no matter which side of the planet you live on.

1. Slap - I can confirm on the behalf of all the humans that ones in your life time someone must have slapped you, can you recall that experience. If you can recall that it's because a slap is such a weird and quick thing that works like a reset button, when you touch a very hot steel, you retreat immediately, knowing that is painful but you don't remember the sensation because you hid it with the sounds you make with your mouth, or just jump around to distract yourself, or quickly dip you finger in the cold water. anything to avoid that burning sensation, but a slap is something we remember because it works like a reset button and our mind freeze for few second, its alert and alive but freezed, what you feel some electrifying sensation around the slapped skin, then a pulsating hot temperature around the same area, watery eyes, if you are fragile then pain and blood through the nostril. Because of the brain freeze you feel all that, thats why there is shame attached to a slap, they say kill me among the million but a slap among a small crowd, That a big No. Its a bad feeling and you want to avoid it but can't and you you come back to sense, you adjust your hair or pretend as nothing happened, you can accept the fact that you can't avoid the sensation of slap.

But when some one insults you, you have coping mechanism, if the insult or pain is extreme you dissociate into a different personality or if the insult is less then a comfort movie or talking to that friend who listens and provides you with comfort is just with in reach for you to make feel better.

Lets list some, comforts: comfort movie, comfort friend, comfort food like pizza or fries, comfort beer, or safe place, like a spot in a park or a terrace. or a tea, or a coffee, or a quick nap, or keeping a pet, or a reel that you have saved for different reasons that you never visits, or an interview of your ideal, or a yoga practice, or a walk, or a visit to a temple, if its to fucked up then visiting a far temple in the mountains like kedar nath, or a trip with friend. 
We do a thousand thing just to avoid pain, but we never try to understand pain but we are busy in avoiding it. look for yourself. 

2. If the first example is unrelated to you then this one will give you the right idea. Have you ever asked yourself why when you have fever you just think to much that it makes you sweat and make you head hurt, its another uncomfortable pain that we cant avoid. The fever, we all get it, its good for the body, you immune system is getting stronger. But you have observed that the intensity of your thoughts are so heavy that it hurt your brain, you close your eyes and the thoughts goes more intense. Let me tell you why, it's the response of the body to this uncomfortable things happening in you body, by thinking to to much it try to avoid you attention from the fever to thinking, you concern is this temperature and weakness but all the attempt is useless, see for yourself when you are in fever, it does happen.

3. When you bath with a cold water you use words or jumping jacks before you pour the water, some chant mantras, some repeat the name of their favorite deity. Ram, ram, ram. Or, Shyam, shyam, shyam. Or, if you are atheist, then you repeat fuck, fuck, fuck. or, you simply scream. so, have you ever notice what a mug of cold water on you body feels like, no. But an ice cream more colder the the cold water, which can also gives brain freeze, you love it and you have preference. mine is butter scotch. see how we know pleasure but when it comes to pain we avoid it.

Next is collecting pleasure.



## collecting pleasure:

No matter what we like, want or desire for ourself unpredictability of life will always be there no-matter what you do, and secretly we accept that thats why we collect pleasure to avoid that unpredictability, from the point you wake up to the point you sleep. you have safe, and comforting pleasures that you chase. 

1. The day is not going in your favour, you watch your comfort movie that is there for this exact situation when you loose the grip on the day, i forget the ice cream tub, obviously sugar free.

Our physical existence is about duality, you and me, him or her, this and that, here and there, good and bad, beautiful and ugly, happy and sad. Thats the truth of our physical existence, duality really exist in you mind, not in reality. lets say beeauty---- dad bods were, beautiful, thic booty was beautifull, now zero figure is beautiful.
                


The things we really dislikes, the things that really gives us pain we try to avoid it because pleasure feels good. so we chase pleasure. After a shitty day you dont hustle for your pation. you play video game. to . win.
