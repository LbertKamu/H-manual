# What is a human being?
We are trying to understand how a human being function, physically or psychologically, and knowing it, is fairly easy because we are human being. 
Don't you think it's absurd that a thing is trying to understand itself, its the thing, and its itself, what's there to understand, when it is, it, but we are here suffering and trying to understand ourself through a guru, through a book, or through mythology or god knows how many things we have smeared upon us listening to everybody other then ourself. The only solution we have is to watch ourself in daily life. What the fuck we do or what the fuck we have smeared upon us that makes us suffer. We have to see it.

Lets look at an example to really understand.

  
#### Optics and seeing.
**Pythagoras, he was active during 590 BC** when he first observed light on his window, light was always there but it was pythagoras who looked at it differently, he saw outside his window that his wife was hanging cloths, they were of different colors, only rich could afford colorful cloths and drapes. As he was a great thinker of his time. So, he thought about seeing things, where he concluded that we see objects and things because our eyes emit rays that touches the object around us and result of it is that we see things, if the rays are not there in our eyes we could not see things. He demonstrated his finding by asking people to close their eyes and all the people gasped seeing that closing their eyes really stops the emitted rays leaving their eyes. As soon as they opened their eyes, some people felt rays leaving there eyes. Young women got there heart broken as they wanted to be with pythagoras to feed him grapes as he lay on the comforting silk bed, but he was married. 

**Aristotle, he was active during, 410 BC, almost 80 years after pythagoras**
```(if you are confused with the concept of BC: 500BC means 500 years before the birth of christ and 300Bc means 300 years before the birth of the christ. so 500 is older and 300 is younger as it is close to the birth of christ. say hallelujah!)```
So, Aristotle looked at the light and he thought of pythagoras theory about the nature of seeing, he closed and opened his eyes to experience the emitted rays, but all he could experience was pain in his eyes from all the closing and opening. In doing so he discoverd that he sat in the morning trying to understand the nature of seeing and now its evening and the sun was going down and its dark because the stars were covered by gloomy roaring dark clouds, and the clouds were visible only when they roared with lightning. so, aristotle was staring at the dark sky in the night when a thunder roared louder then anything he had heard in his lifetime, it was a bright flash of chaos where everything around his vision was visible and then again darkness, the dog howled and the lantern were hanging loose. When it hit him, that vision depends on the light not on rays emit by the eyes. He proposed that objects are visible because light illuminates them. He demonstrated it by asking people to wait and see another lightning strike.
When it happened it was noted that aristotle has added something meaningful to the observation of the world. Scholars and fellow thinkers accepted his theory, but people rejected it because they find that eyes emitting rays is cooler then the rays blooms the objects for us to see. So, no young women were interested in feeding grapes to aristotle.

**In the 11th century(1,590 years after pythagoras.)  Ibn al-Haytham, we know him as the father of optics**
He also observed light and its relation to objects. He also rejected the eyes emit rays theory when he tirelessly studied the behavior of light, shadows, and reflection and proposed that we se things because light rays from sunlight reflects off the object and enters through our eyes. He wrote about it in his book, the book of optics. The young women feeding grapes ritual was not performed anymore, because now this man belonged to islam and its different culture and different religion, so, no grapes for him.

**In 17th century(2,260 years after pythagoras.) Isaac Newton** work on the nature of light expanded as more tools were available. He demonstrated that the light is made up of different colors, reflection and refraction which plays important role in how we human being perceive objects.

## When you put sunlight through a prism it splits into seven colors. Below is a real image.

## So, my point is to discover something that is so common and daily experience of life that is, seeing things around us took us 2,260 years to observe and discover. and what we discovered was always there, but few paid attention for a span of 2,260 years to discover such glorious process that always existed in front of us so simply and effortlessly. All it took is this much of attention.

Now, the main point.It took us that long to discover because it was something that existed outside of what human being is. you know, light exist without our eyes to perceive them. Now, to discover the nature of human being, it should not take us thousands of years as we are trying to understand ourself. The only things we need to understand is that if being a conscious being is a possibility then getting ignorant is also a possibility and this journey that we need to take is for the understanding of that ignorance that stops us from being a human being that our creator designed us to be. 
I am the guy who had a lot of time on his hand, and he spent his afternoon and the late nights just observing himself finding where things went wrong, and in doing so, he discovered something cool and obvious that he was ignorant about, because his education was wrong, the influence were wrong and this is his small attempt to try to fix that for other if they want to, he begin this book just to point out for people, things that they can also observe about them self. So, that they can also see where they went wrong.
Lets begin the journey of the self discovery.
