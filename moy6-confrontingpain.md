## confronting pain.

What do you do when you are faced with these:

Loneliness, boredom, sadness, dis-satisfaction.

These are the reasons we cry, we want to die, we are miserable. These are also  psychological pain, that we feel deep inside us. But why they are there, and how we avoid them and run away from it, or want to find the quickest solution possible to just rid of them.

1. Ask yourself what do you do when you feel lonely, you think about your friends in college, how you used to have fun, that carelessness that you miss now, because you have to do a shitty job every day and the dissatisfaction is so heavy on you that the empty nights eat you. Or you think about your relationship how it used to be fun and now all you do is fight, and you feel lonely even though you used to think that, ones I am with this girl or a boy, Nothing can bother me, she or he is the home I was looking for all my life, But now that home is the reason you feel lonely.

* Just because we are suffering and are lonely we try to solve it, and create more problem out of it. Instead what if we understand what is loneliness and just eradicate it. That is much easier. We will talk about solutions in the next chapter.

2. Ask yourself what you do when you are sitting in boredom. The activity that used to give you pleasure is not giving it any more, has it ever happened to you that using instagram, while doom scrolling become this boring activity that you rest you phone and think about what the fuck you are doing with you life.
  
When you get bored, its because the interesting activities are not interesting anymore and the solution is you collect different pleasure, you try to meditate, you do yoga, go for a run, anything other then the activity that you are used to do, but after a while when you are fine, you go back to using instagram. Has it happen to you, that you uninstall instagram then re-install it. You uninstall pubg and then re-install it.
  
you exhaust an activity that you don't feel like doing anymore. Listening to you favorite music again and again to the point where you abandon it, its boring now, and you add it to your playlist, among the same songs you were obsessed with.
so, boredom is simply an activity that doesn't give you pleasure anymore. see, for yourself in your life. We all love sunset, but if we have to watch it everyday its boring right. But why its boring, if the first time we liked it. we will answer it. I am just explaining the problems for now. 

3. Sadness, its the same when things doesn't go according to you. You feel sad, and that fine, but as we collect pleasure, life collect sadness for us to create a perfect balance. The loop that we talked about it exist as part of the existence.

4. dis-satisfaction, its also a larger scheme of life, we are dissatisfied with our current life and we are doing things to rid of this dis-satisfaction, looking for another job, looking for passion; Majorly we look at the life of a person we admire and we want to be them because we think somehow becoming like them will give us satisfaction. But let me tell you even elon musk take ketamine for his depression and he is the most coolest guy, for me at-least, on the planet right now and he says he goes into a negative space and he needs ketamine for that. He will get satisfaction when he will make humans a multi-planetary species. Thats an extreme example. For us, we want to be a banker, a CA, an officer, artist because we have this feeling that there is satisfaction there and you are ready to take as much pain as you can just for that dream, while avoiding  that pain using instant pleasures that we collect, like smoking, drinking, drugs, listening to music, watching movie, talking to a girlfriend or boyfriend. 
  
Ones you reach there, the thing you wanted to be in you life, you are still dis-satisfied. I am going to prove it why we are who have achieved things that we wanted and are still dis-satisfied. 
   
The problem is, people who attach satisfaction to a goal will never be satisfied because they approach it with pre defined imagination that ones they achieve this goal they will have this and this and that, because the people they admire are showing thinks that these people interpret as something that gives satisfaction and when they finally reach there and it doesn't match with what they thought it will offer, it make them even more dissatisfied, because before now there was the pain of getting to what you want, but now their is nothing, but pure depression and even more dissatisfaction. 
  
These people if they have energy they pursue another goal, without realizing that what they see online is just a show not the real intimate life of a person and then they go at it again, they get stuck in a loop of making a goal and achieving it.
  
And if they don't have the energy to pursue another goal they turn to spirituality and they think only spirituality can solve this depression, thats why people choose to follow a guru who initiate them into yogic practice and give them a new lifestyle.
   
But people who love the process are satisfied most of the time, singers get satisfaction from singing not releasing music. Writers get satisfy from writing not publishing, yes publishing will give immense satisfaction, but nothing compare to writing a new thing or writing a good scene or a poem, the act of creation is always satisfying. A teacher get satisfaction in teaching, a coder in coding. Goals are the byproduct of the life you have chosen, if what you are doing make you famous, then its ok but chasing fame and putting you life on hold till you are famous will eat you from inside. People who love the process of anything they do, will be satisfied by the process itself.
  
so, dis-satisfaction is there because you think you are not there, where you are supposed to be and its been eating you, and you beat this dis-satisfaction buy doing things that give you instant pleasure, the smoking, the sex, the alcohol, the weed the drugs, entertainment, self amusing, cricket whatever we can collect, you are a marvel fan but a time will come when you will choose to watch the star wars because thats how the mind works, constant seeking pleasure not looking what dis-satisfaction is.

The, more lonely, the more bored you are, the more entertainment, and pleasure you chase. They grow together to a point where you want to leave everything and follow a guru or listening to you parents and limiting yourself into a safe pattern of society, anything that can fucking remove this dis-satisfaction and loneliness, you will listen to anybody and yor are so fragile that people use your suffering to sell you all the rituals and spiritual, sexual, tantric programs, but All you had to do was, understand the cycle or loop of this pleasure and pain.

## Now consider this diagram.
Pleasure feels good. Our day revolve around these pleasure and we form a habit to revisit these pleasures everyday because they are safe and we are used to them. But a time will come when these pleasure will not give pleasure because of the repetition we exhaust these pleasure, or a situation make you lost all your current pleasures, like leaving college for a job, leaving one job for another and you have to re-find these pleasure.

`the gap between one pleasure and another is boredom. and a gap between leaving your one pleasure to another pleasure is loneliness.`

so, inputs are the life you experience: experience can be good or bad depending on the situation you are facing and how it interacts with your five senses. If it pleases you then its a good experience, if it dis-pleases you then its a bad experience, because day(inputs) is as alive as you are, it can turn you good experience into bad, and bad experience into good(when you tasted the beer for the first time its was bitter but now you drink it like water without flinching your eyes).
So, because the day has the power to change your good into bad, and bad into good. life becomes unpredictable, and we accept this un-predictability and know it exist and to avoid it we find security into different set of pleasures and we depend on them. And when these pleasure are not there you get bored and find new pleasures. And a time comes when these collected pleasure get exhausted either by over use or by changing city or home and you feel lonely till you find different set of pleasure. 
and this constant cycle of pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain, such as loneliness, boredom, ect ect. It grows and grows to a point where you cant take it anymore and you make stupid decision after stupid decision till you find book like these to aid to you life. or you find a fake guru who fix you up a spiritual life.(I know a lot to take in, but this loop is the problem and it grows, look at the map now, and you will see it. )
