## Conclusion and truth.
Now we are beginning to dig the surface. so, to identify the shit in our life that is, the things that make us suffer. Now, to identify the things that makes us suffer needs some clarity, because knowing the `true facts(truth)` about life will solve the problem, but a `conclusion` about that truth will bind us and make us suffer. so, all we need to do is to see what is true(truth) and what is false(conclusion).

 ## First we should define what is conclusion and what is truth?


---

### conclusion:
``` Conclusion is something that is different for different people.``` For example see this video(for hindi speakers only): [click here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Bxq7oRHHxLs)

### Truth:
``` It is something that stays the same, it doesn't change just because you think so.```

``` 
You draw the conclusion, whereas you discover the truth, because the truth exist without you, and conclusions are based on the experiences we have as an individual.

```

## Story of truth through an example:-

### How early men started to discover the language of god that is mathematics.
I said language of god because it is something which existed all along for us conscious being to discover.
#### So, here it goes.
When we started to gather around as a species, we automatically discovered counting numbers as how many people are there in a group, and when we started gathering cattle and cultivated the land for food, naturally we started to ask ourself. What is the area of land where we keep our cattle, and grow our crops.  

 A genius among the first men made a meter long and meter wide square shape frame with chopping wood and started to measure the area of the land manually counting 1 square, 2 square.... bending down again and again, by the evening  people were started to gather around to see this fool. The sun was slitting down, our guy was in sweat and was about to complete his round, 540 square, 541 square... The sun went down when he got up with an aching back, and screamed his lungs out that the land is 550 meter^2^  (because the square from wood that he made was 1 meter by 1 meter so its meter X meter = meter^2^ ) And every one clapped,jumped, and howled it's weird but they are early humans so it was common practice. And our guy just now calculated the area of the given land, but his happiness came to an early end, that is for few days he enjoyed the company of best women and best of the fresh food, Until another guy who looked at the length and breadth of the same land, because he was intrigued by the idea that a meter by meter is a meter square and the whole land is measured with meter by meter square. So, what will happen if he multiply the total length of the land with its breadth, and the moment he multiplied it the answer came the same 550 m^2^, same as the guy who took all of his day measuring the land meter by meter, bending up and bending down. The new guy got up in frenzy and begun to spread his discovery all over the place. All the glory which include the beautiful women and gifted slaves, they left the guy who measured it manually and gathered around the guy who simply multiplied the length of the land to its breadth. Now, he was the happy one.

500 years after that, someone asked about the area of circle. He asked the question to himself that we are able to find the area of a land but what about circle, how do we find the area of a circle and he began his experiment, the civilization is far modern now, they had invented the wheel, and our guy has it. What he did was he marked a straight line on the top side of the wheel and he rolled the wheel on the brown wet soil, from the tip where he marked the initial line to it's other end, which left the rectangular mark on the land, which we call it now as circumference and then he measured the diameter of the same wheel and then he divided the circumference of the wheel to its diameter and the number came close to 3.14. After measuring multiple sizes of different wheels he discovered a magical truth about the mathematics. He discovered that when we divide the circumference of a circle with its diameter we get the value of 3.14 which is the value for the unit we call now as pi, its a constant number no mater the scale of a circle. Even if you take the orbit of our planet around the sun, it will also has the same number if you divide the circumference to its diameter the number will come the same that is 3.14. He didn't discover the area of circle but paved the way for another human to discover the area of circle and without the magic of 3.14 we couldn't possibly draw the are of circle. You see the truth is there to be discovered, the pi = 3.14 always was present every moment of our existence but it took a man to observe and discover it.
`you discover the truth, or it falls upon you because you were looking not searching but looking`
The discovery took hundred's of years for us to discover, and we today have it on a single page of the math textbook. Don't you think its amazing.
I am giving this math example because this book is the example of truth related to human existence and there suffering. And I don't want to touch the suffering part yet in this chapter. So bear with the math example.

## Story of conclusion through an example.

Gendun chophel. He is really inspirational for me, because of him I get to know something very profound. We will talk about the profound in further chapters.
He was a monk in tibet looking for divine experiences and enlightenment and he became a scholar and a poet of spirituality and buddhism who is able to get his work published in the west. So, when he visited the west and because of the influence of some pervert men he found himself in a brothel with a glass of whiskey. You know what went through that night; I won't describe it. Gendun chophel indulged in alcohol and sex, and you know, what he wrote the next day.
```"Sex and alcohol is the closest thing to experiencing divine, and every one should live  a sensory life."```

Yo see the problem right, for us sex and alcohol is a taboo and we do it for pleasure and to make babies, but for someone like him who was trained to be a celibate from the childhood, who don't even had the playboy magazine to teach him things and the shortage of women around him in the monastery, His that side never grew because he never knew it existed, but he was taught that the greatest pleasure in this existence is enlightenment, which he was chasing from childhood to his adulthood but couldn't find it. Finally founds it in sex and alcohol and on the other hand we exist who also indulged in sex and alcohol to relieve ourself of pain and misery and we run to a guru to get us enlightenment as to really find the ultimate pleasure which will cure us from our misery. really we are not looking for enlightenment we just want the paradise where the misery is not there and for that we can exchange our left nut if we have to. Enlightenment is another way we think we can remove the misery but thats not the case, the solution does't lie in the solution of misery but it lies in the cause of misery, and the cause of misery is the shit we need to see and find to eradicate it. 
Eradicate means: destroy the things to it bare atoms and its existence is nowhere to be seen again. Fucking eradicate it. The word is so cool.

Gendun chophel, if you don't believe me here is the link to his wikipedia page. [Read for yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendün_Chöphel)

So, in mathematics our genius people discovered the magic numbers and there relations to each other and our existence, we people didn't made it up. Its like mankind is able to get the rough copy of our creator(god), where we have all the truth scattered for us to make sense of it.

Whereas, Gendun Chophel living the life of a monk, indulged in sex and alcohol for the first time in later life, made it his truth and at the end died in a brothel. He sure died a happy man, but from our eyes, he was a bastard who indulges in filthy activity and couldn't find true love. IF you didn't understand, he made a conclusion about what divine is and lived according to it.
Where as, an early genius discovered that circumference/diameter = pi. Try to disproof that. He didn't made conclusion but observed a pattern and discovered the truth. Which existed all along for him to discover. 
So, in this book we are going to discover truth about the human existence, how we are able to discover the truth, why cant a dog discover the same truth like we can. Why are we allowed to discover the patterns in this universe. For what purpose.

So, conclusion is something which people draw based on there experience, like for gendun chophel sex and alcohol is the closest thing to divine and for us its an activity to rid us of pain and a breakup. so these are two conclusion, but what sex and alcohol truly is just an activity that gives us a bit of pleasure. 

Truth is something which exist in the present, it is not dependent upon you or anyone its their screaming at you face to be discovered, you can't draw it, you can't do anything about it, it is obsolete either you know it or you don't.
Like, pi = 3.14 its the truth try to disproof it, you can gather a million people and make them believe that pi is equal to 2.34 but the truth will not change because a million people believe in it. The truth is Pi will always be 3.14.
