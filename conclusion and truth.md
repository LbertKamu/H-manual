## Conclusion and truth.
Now we are begining to dig the surface. so, first we should define what is conclusion and what is truth.

---

### conclusion:
``` It is something that is different for different people.``` For example see this video(for hindi speakers only): [click here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Bxq7oRHHxLs)

### Truth:
``` It is something that stays the same, it doesn't change just because you think so.```

``` 
You draw the conclusion, whereas you discover the truth, because the truth exist without you, and conclusions are based on the experiences we have as an individual.

```

## Story of truth through an example:-

When we started to gather around we automatically discovered counting numbers. Really we don't know when we begun counting numbers. We startred gatherign cattles, and started to cultivate the food and naturally we started to ask ourself, what is the area of land where we keep our cattle, and a genius made a meter long and meter wide square with choping wood and started to measure the area of the land counting 1 square, 2 square.... bending down again and again, by the evening when people gathered to see this fool. The sun was sliting down, our guy was in sweat and was about to complete his round. The sun went down when he got up with an aching back, and screamed his lung out that the land is 550 meter^2^  (because the square from wood was 1 meter by 1 meter so its meter X meter = meter^2^ ) And every one clapped,jumped, and howled it's weird but they are early humans so its common practice. And our guy just calculated the area of the given land, but his happiness was ended early, that is for few days he enjoyed the company of best females and best of the fresh food. Until another guy who looked at the length and breadth of the same land, because he was intrigued by the idea that a meter by meter is a meter square and the whole land is measured with meter by meter square. So, what will happen if he multiply the total length of the land with its breadth. and the moment he multiplied it the answer came the same as the guy who took all of his day measuring the land. He got up in frenzy and spread his discovery all over the place. All the glory left the guy who measurd it manually and gathered around the guy who simply multiplied it. Now, he was the happy one.

500 years after that, someone asked about the area of circle. He asked that we are able to find the area of a land but what about circle. And he begun his expeiment, the civilization is far modern now, they have invented the wheel. And our guy have it. What he did was he marked a straight line on the top side of the wheel. he measured the wheele diameter and he rolled the wheel on the brown soil, from the tip where he marked the initial line to it's other end, which left the mark on the land, which he calculated. which we call A circumfrence now. after measuring multiple size of the wheel he discovered a magical truth about the mathematics. He discovered that when we divide the circumfrence of a circle with its diameter we get the value of 3.14 which is the value for pi, its a constant number no mater the scale of a circle. Even if you take the orbit of our planet around the sun, it will also has the same number. 
The discovery took hundred's of years for us to discover, and we today have it on a single page of the textbook. Don't you think its amazing.
I am giving this math example because this book is the example of truth related to human existence and there sufferning. And I dont want to touch the suffering part yet in this chapter. So bear with it.
