## Conclusion and truth.
Now we are begining to dig the surface. so, first we should define what is conclusion and what is truth.

---

### conclusion:
``` It is something that is different for different people.``` For example see this video(for hindi speakers only): [click here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Bxq7oRHHxLs)

### Truth:
``` It is something that stays the same, it doesn't change just because you think so.```

``` 
You draw the conclusion, whereas you discover the truth, because the truth exist without you, and conclusions are based on the experiences we have as an individual.

```
