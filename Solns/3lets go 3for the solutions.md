Solution:
When I say solution there is nothing but shit to see. Now, in a moment we are going to see the shit and if you have the courage to see the shit and remove it, then.... nothing, shit will get solved. Why I say courage, its because you are going to face what you have avoided your whole life. And it's not a easy thing to do, even though all the needed facts are lingering around you this very instant.

Every one says you are the problem. You are responsible for your happiness and you are responsible for your misery. Right. I feel like punching those people who don’t complete these sentence. You should ask them politely saying. “Ok I am responsible for my misery, but sir can you tell me what about me that is causing that suffering.” The man answering the question will surely fumble and feed bullshit to you, because camera is on and he or she can get captured for not having the answer, because that will be meme worthy material. So, he is fearful. 

So, let me tell you the answer what about us that creates that misery. Hopefully camera is not on. It’s not an answer but something to see and realize. Like a light bulb switching on, where you say, "fuck why haven’t I saw that before." The nature of truth is such that its here in front of us screaming like this dog, who barks. I am not talking about me, but a real dog outside, on the street. He barks a lot and always stay active. As if checking every fifteen minutes, if he has his voice or not.

I am gonna throw some random words at you which are the problems and solutions as well. because we are approaching all the discomforts of human problem, and we can't solve them like we solve a math problem, as by doing something about it applying rules and formulas to get to the desirable result. We are approaching it with a mind who is not conditioned to solve a human problem like a math problem.

What does a mind like this do, who is not conditioned to solve a human problem like a math problem. Because then nothing is a problem, but you will only feel pain or discomfort and then you will look at it like, why the discomfort is their, what did I do that this is happening to me. Then you will see the cause of that pain and as you are still conditioned you will see that conditioning in action, as so, the brain will try to find a solution, or try to escape for the problem itself. Then you will see both the cause of the pain and what your brain is trying to do to fix it. All you have to do is close the tap(cease the cause). Then wipe the floor, then the floor can have the chance to dry, either you wipe it or let the water evaporate slowly it doesn't matter because the tap is closed, no amount of water can come through it, now you know the source and you can open and close according to you needs(I hope you remember this example from the past chapter, I think we will re-visit it.)

Earlier we saw that we are stuck in the endless cycle of `pursuing pleasure` and `avoiding pain`. I drew the whole map.
1. Their is pain of pursuing pleasure if you get it you are happy and if you don't you are miserable right.

2. YOU AVOID PAIN thats a big pain, and you are avoiding it for eternity, little inconvenience happen and you grab one of your collected pleasure. Watch a movie, eat a tub of sugar free ice cream. ect.

So, first is you pursue pleasure. 
Second is you avoid pain

**Now what goes into pursuing pleasure and what goes into avoiding pain we will see**(these both concepts are like maths formulas that we usually use to solve our discomforts and misery. And we know now that we don't approach human problem like a math problem.)

## Lets look at first, pursuing pleasure. Why do we pursue pleasure. 
1. because it feels good.
2. Because we want to avoid pain.

Because it feels good and its natural, Its totally stupid to avoid pleasure. If a girl I like ask me to kiss her, I won’t say "no, I don't take pleasure because it is the reason I feel lonely. I will kiss you a thousand times and when you will not be there, I will feel lonely and so on, so on."(we have proved in earlier chapter that the more pleasure you have in your life, the more pain you can feel because now you have something greater to loose.)   
 If it comes you way accept it or if its within reach enjoy it, read a novel, buy that coffee or watch a tree waving, anything but don't suffer the choice. Pleasure comes your way, take it and if you don't want to take it, then don't.

Now chasing pleasure is stupid, what are you avoiding. Their must be something that you are avoiding if you feel restless to grab onto a pleasure. Something to see their. Right. 
When we chase pleasure, and chasing pleasure means getting restless for something to relieve you, like you are at home and you are waiting to go out for a cigarette, and you are restless till you smoke a cigarette. Or, you are being restless to eat certain fast food. Or, anything, looking for a movie to watch as your food is getting cold. Charging your phone while pressing your butt, as you have to take a shit. Chasing a girl, dreaming about her, trying to stalk her or dreaming about meeting her. Or, you trying to chase your ambition about something because you think their is comfort at the end of you ambition.
   
When we are in the process of chasing, we are avoiding the problem, the real human problem. And chasing pleasure is a formula we use to solve the human problem. You have to see it in your life, see yourself when you are chasing pleasure, or looking for solution which can provide comfort to you situation, pleasure is a spectrum from comfort to peak happiness. everything that feels good is pleasure.
Chasing pleasure means, doing anything to solve the human problem that you facing right now but that's not the way. see if its true, see the cause. 
Because next chapter is about the cause and pains of human. or human problems.
