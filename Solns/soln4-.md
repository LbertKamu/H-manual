se we have learned that good experience and bad experiences are the pleasures and pains that happened in the past. And collection of these good and bad experiencea, pain and pleasure are called Memories. That is stored in our brain. In short memory is the past, the things that happened.
But, life is happening every moment, even if you die it will keep happening for a long long time.
When what happened meets with what's happening. Its chaos.
When your past memories meet the happening life. Its chaos. For now.

When we have enough good memories related to the object of pleasure(like good memories related to your girlfriend), we get the illusion that we have security, because it feels good again and again, we are safe here, we have pleasure here, because our memories are good. Which can shatter anytime. In truth their is no security. Its right in-front of you but you don't see that because somehow your memories has created this beautiful illusion of security.

Question: so, Whats in the memories that creates these illusion?

Answer: Your ability to recall the memory, Its like a hard disk with your memories scattered around that you can access anytime you want, That ability of recalling a memory is called `Thought`. The ability to modify that recalled memory is called imagination. The ability of altering a past memory  and imagination is called Thinking.
The problem is all this and the solution is to understand it. So, lets understand it.
