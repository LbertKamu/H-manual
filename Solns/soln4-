se we have learned that good experience and bad experiences are the pleasures and pains that happened in the past. And collection of these good and bad memories, pain and pleasure are called Memories. That is stored in our brain. In short memory is the past, the things that happened.
But, life is happening every moment, even if you die it will keep happening for a long long time.
When what happened meet with what's happening. Its chaos.
When your past memories meet the happening life. Its chaos. For now.

When we have enough good memories related to the object of pleasure(like good memories related to your girlfriend), we get the illusion that we have security because our memories are good. Which can shatter anytime. In truth their is no security.

Question: so, Whats in the memories that creates these illusion.?
