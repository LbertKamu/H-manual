Suppose while sitting at your home you watched a reel about a fast car name ferrari, and it talked about that this car company doesn't advertise their cars because its so expensive and classy that a person who watches tv on a regular basis, can't even think to buy it, because he is not worth it. if he has the time to watch tv instead of earning a wealth, he can't even afford it. 
You feeling guilty, rest the phone on you side.
`Now you have a memory of this reel and a fact about that car, that you could not afford it, only classy people buy it, rich people buy it.`
---
Now, you are walking down the street, smoking your cigarette and suddenly you heard a roar, a rich roar, you turned and saw a sports car, and a ferrari logo. `you recalled your memory of that reel`
You saw a man with loose white shirt and a red goggles, looking extra clean, throttling the engine, everyone is looking at him and his car, but he is unbothered, he is looking straight.`You created a memory that connects itself with that reel memory` ` Now, you imagined yourself, sitting in that car, with a israile model beside you, riding on the street of venis, you imagined your friend are jelous of your life style, your mom is proud, all women you know are thristing around you, you already have many sensation in your body and just by imagining it, you feel butterfly in your stomach. and your heart is vibrating with a tickling bass, the surge of energy in your body is so high that you can win this world if you want to. you thought to yourself if imagining about it feels this good, if I get it then their will be true happiness.
`now, you begin to think what are things you can do to achieve this, achieve this car and all that, first you thought you need to stop watching tv and reels. Learn something that can make money and all sorts of plans`

---
So, you created the memory, modified it with imagination, and altered it with thinking as what to do about it, and you act from that.

Example: 
1. you meet a girl, you perceive her as cute, charming and soft sounding, cheerful girl. You want to date her. and you have asked her out and you are in a relation ship(to good to be true, but we are imagining)`you perceived her as like this, this, and that and you see value in her personality and you made her you girlfriend.`
2. You started to live with her all day every day in the ugly parts of life, you saw that she looks good because she spent 1.5 hours in makeup. She is a jealous person and checks your phone and don't like you talking to other girls. and many many ugly discoveries.`you are just waiting to do a breakup because your own memory deceived you. you realised that your initial memories of her are created during the time of her best behavior but now that you live with her, she is a totally different person, that you don't like and breakup is natural`

3. Same with ambition. You desire to be a person like elon musk, but all you have the memory of his best behavior and col moments. and you chasing that experience that your memory perceive will again fool you, because the amount of hours he put into work every day and for years to achieve what you perceive as cool and you want that. 

---
We have to see the limited nature of our memory, then it will have no effect on your existence.

---
Now, the problem with memory is that without memory, their is no imagination, and without imagination their is no thinking.
----
If memory doesn't interfere with your life, you will live a great life.
But memory is triggered everything around us, and we are bound to modify it and think about it.
