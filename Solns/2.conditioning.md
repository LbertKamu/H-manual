Pain and suffering are like the kiss of jesus. Said mother teresa.
What people did listening to this is, when ever their kid got hurt or wounded, they use this sentence as a aid, to calm down the kid, never looking at the absurdity of this sentence.
If jesus loves everyone equally why pain and suffering is like a kiss, not love and laugh, but no one asks that question. Because they are conditioned to not question the authority figure from the childhood. Don't talk back, don't raise voice, Don't say odd shit. Don't ask questions.
I hope mother teresa had explained why she made that sentence, somewhere.
  
### Let's break this condition and ask ourself this question.
Why she said pain and suffering is like kiss of jesus, but the fact is she is dead. What option do we have, lets ask ourself. What's their in pain thats equal to  jesus kiss.
When you are in pain, not physical, but mental pain. We don't suffer outside. The rainy day is not melancholic. When you are melancholic,  torrential rain before a pale sky adds up to the mood.
Som when you are suffering and you don't try to solve it, because you don't know what solving problem is regarding human problem. You simply look at it and see the cause and eradicate it. and when you do it enough time then no amount of suffering can touch you and that's equal to jesus kiss. or krishna kiss. Whose ever kiss you want.

### More about conditioning:

You can't escape conditioning, its their in everyone no-matter who you are, you yourself condition yourself by following self imposed rules, and that fine, they are there to ease your day, and you can change them of you want to, you are not attach to them. You know that these rules are their for you, you are not going to impose them onto anyone.

For say, you make a rule for yourself that you have planed you weakly meals and you are not going to decide everyday what you are going to eat. Now, did you imposed this rule because your job require you to to take multiple decisions and fixing you meal for everyday is the best option to take one less decision. Thats fine because this comes out of necessity.
Now, if you are doing this because you father used to do this , or you grandfather and you are following that, then its a problem. Why are you doing this are you conditioned.
`you are conditioned to read a book an hour before going to sleep. Now, your sleep depend on this one hour.
