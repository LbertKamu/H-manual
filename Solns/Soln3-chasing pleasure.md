Some common pleasure are:
1. Fast food that mostly give pleasure to our taste buds.
2. Movies, they make a thousand every year, so, you can watch movies and feel different good emotion.
3. social media, which is filled with unlimited source of memes.
4. Games: they are like movies but you have the control.
5. Traveling, exploring. We feel good.
6. Having friends.
7. A place to call Home.
8. Having pets.
9. Having different hobbies.
10. Festivals.
11. Birthdays, the only day when people treats you special.
12. Reading a fiction or non fiction book.
13. A girlfriend or boyfriend.
14. Drugs. smoking. alcohol. Weed.

Things mention above are somethings that can give you pleasure in long term. and because its long term, we feel that yes in this fresh life that is new every moment their is security, security being things that can keep us safe in time of discomfort or displeasing, in-short pleasures to fight this unpredictability. So, we can depend on things to deal with the unpredictability and when unpredictability comes knocking at your door saying. " I will fuck you up".
You cry.

So, what illusion is this. We are clever and we have found pleasure that can run for long term. you are safe. So, when ever you see in news that people in different country are loosing their hut over fire or wind. You feel safe that you have a concrete home. When you have a girlfriend and you see a person indulging in alcohol after breaking and going on a journey of self destruction, you feel bad for him but you feel safe that you have a stable relationship. When you see that million of people died in corona and you are living in a less crowded place and all your family members are safe, you appreciate you home, your wife, or your job that kept you save.

So, over time you create these good associated memories related to your pleasures, like a home, a girlfriend, a mother, a car, an iphone, money. and it creates an illusion of security. And it is security for the time being. be thankful about it. 

But when the illusion breaks. It hurts equally. You depend on you girlfriend for all the pleasures. If she dump you. You will go on a journey of self destruction. you will feel loneliness. Because the illusion was so strong in your memory that when it broke, your reality shattered.

So, the truth is to see that their is no security. you could die any moment for no reasons at all. you can loose your job for many reasons. Their is a reason people go crazy for a government job, it gives you security that a private company could never give you. But the truth is their is no security in anything. And thats a fact.
---
See it and you will see, you know if you want to know if it's true. See what are your fears. If you have fear you have the illusion of security. Do you fear, that someone will scratch your car. Do you fear that your sons will through you out. Do, you fear that you will loose your job. Do you fear that your loved one might die. Do you fear you might die.

We will tackle fear in next chapter, but for now, If you want to see what false security you have in your life you look at your fear.
---
So, when your collected pleasure feels good in long term, you collect more good memories related to your pleasures and in turns your memories creates an illusion that you have security. Which their is not. See for yourself. People in japan loose their sense of security ever year when they feel the grand levels of earthquake. Years of collected safety smear into dust just with an earthquake. 
---
Again memory is the culprit, it created the good memories related to the object of pleasure and made you believe that their is security.
---
so, again are we stupid that our memory fooled us. It fooled us into thinking that the thing that has given me pleasure in the past, is endlessly going to give pleasure every time. But I now see that, it felt good in the past but me expecting it to feel good every time it do it is stupid. I see that. 
I also see that, some how, There are pleasure which can give pleasures for long term and my memory again fooled me into thinking that their is security in these long term pleasure, and when it breaks, I feel lonely, bored. Until I replace it with lets say another girlfriend, and i get stuck in the cycle of pain and pleasure. Going relationship after relationship until I get married and that also exhaust and the relationship is stuck in a boring bond. And having affair seem intriguing.
Why my mind want's security in the first place.?

Answer: your mind want security because of the survival instinct. Its natural to seek security and be happy about it, but problem begins when we think that this security is eternal and will never end, and its not true. 
---
But unless it breaks you believe in it because you have your memories to proof it. All the good memories you have with your girlfriend will become the source of suffering when see would dump you. But because you have memories of this good relationship you see their is security, when its not, you cry, you feel lonely, the city eats you because all the memories attached to her are also shared by all the restaurant, parks or streets. And you look at them and become deeply sad. Places triggeres memories.
---
Now, if discomforts come and the pleasure is not there to support you, for example your girlfriend, now you are suffering and you don't have your girlfriend to make you the dish she make, the coffee you share, or the bed you share when you are sad, or her lap and her caressing you, massaging your head. ect. ect. Its hits hard.
because, the usual is not there suppose you have a shitty day at office and you came home where your girlfriend is not there to support you as you are used to, it will surely hit hard, you will feel lonely.  I call it pain of having a pleasure, because its temporary.

In short, memory is the culprit. Because security is this a lot of good momories related to a longterm pleasure like having a girlfriend. Loneliness is when that security is not there, suffering is facing pain when you don't have pleasure to hide it.
