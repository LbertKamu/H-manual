## Why life is un predictable and can turn our pleasure into pain and otherwise.

Answer: Lets say you recently started to like the coffee, you switched from tea to coffee and this new love is intense you want to have it and you find reasons to have it. You go to that same cafe where a random stranger girl called you and asked you if you would like to join her for a coffee, she was sad and was needing company and you were the only guy who looked decent enough, that she asked you. With  slight hesitation you joined her and she ordered two coffee, the experience was so weird for you that you couldn't tell her that you don't drink coffee but as minute passed you both enjoyed the talk, you had one more coffee with her, you were locking eyes longer then it was needed. She was blushing. You were smiling like you had never, before that you made a note to yourself about smiling on daily basis is good for inner health. You looked at her sipping that coffee. She smiled back and your heart melted right there. Such a soft creature she is, you thought. You listen to her voice, its so soft and so full of life that you have to force your mind into listening what she is saying, other wise you could get lost in those soft spoken words. you imagined her voice could work like magic on you, like a lullaby to a toddler. You had another coffee, you smelled the aroma, it is freshly brewed. You looked at her accepting that this is to much coffee. This coffee is the only thing that was holding you both together here and you secretly wish to drink this coffee for eternity but the time has come to an end, and she had to leave. You talked about that you won't try to know each other and you both will definitely not form any connection through social media.(I am sorry I got carried away.)

Now, you being a coffee lover because of the thing that happened with the random girl in a cafe. Went on a trip and you saw a coffee shop and you ordered one. You took the first sip and it tastes shit. Even though your friends like it.
You pleasure turned into pain. Why?

1. When you like something either it taste good, or smells nice what ever `it was in the past` and because something felt good in the past we think that it's going to feel good again as it did in the past. 
Every good experience and every bad experience you have, is recorded in the past by you and Now you somehow want that record to match in the real time and you compare everything with that recorded memory of the past.

Now, for this example: A good coffee is that It should have the same aroma as it was with the girl, it should be freshly brewed like it did in that cafe with that girl. And coffee should make you feel like as it did in that cafe.
  
  Now, you can have coffee anywhere you can and it's not going to be as good as that day, even when you return to the same cafe, you are not going to have the same experience, you will rely on the memory of that day. While you sip the coffee you will try to recall every moment of that day. And when you are going to drink coffee anywhere else, it will be shit even though its famous in whole city. Chances can be that what coffee you like might be shit but your experience with it is so good that you like that shit. Even people will tell you that you drink a shitty coffee, but you won't accept that because for you its magic.

So, unpredictability of life is every moment you live, and you feel discomfort when life challenges your memory of the past. See it in your life.

When you have to eat a recipe you do not like why is that, for me I never liked soup or stew because elders in my life used to get sick and we all have to eat that soup and stew. And when ever someone fall sick we have to attend to them and we have to eat what that sick person was eating.
---
Now, whenever these soup and stew used to be made in our home, the same feelings associated with these food would come before us.
---
Same, with any recipe that was made during festivals, we liked it and our pleasant memories are attached to these food. We liked these festival food so much that when the day is going bad, we would order it online, to feel good.
---
Everything is related to memory and memory is gathered in past. We compare every thing real with the past. Either its good then the past or bad. If its good then the past. Then this good will become the past and we will say this is good but that was better.
---
But, that's the case that was better in the past and life is moving and nothing is same just because you can record and experience good and bad, you want to kill the real for the past that existed.

---
`every next moment is new, fresh, as it was a thousand years back. But because we can record and form memories.
We try to force this memory onto real, unpredictable, fresh, new and if its according to our memory we go happy that yes it's the same as my memory.
----
If it not match with your memory, you cry.

-----

So, memory is problem but memory is needed you work, to walk to do many many things to survive and live. So, its natural that we use memory where its not needed. We just have to see that when we are living this real and fresh life wer are not comparing it with something that happened in the past. 
---
you look at sunset, without using the memory. Every sunset is new just because you get busy in comparing it with you past memory of sunset, you miss the new.

----

You might discover a purple dip of the sunset or thousands of birds soaring and circling the sun, or a guy next to you in tears because for his this one is the best sunset.

---
`Every moment is fresh, don't let you past memories ruin it, because memory is needed when you want to recall what is 8 * 3 = ? . If your memory was not there you could not answer it rightly.

----
Memory is needed but Don't let it ruin your living the next moment. When ever you feel good, know that its in the past and suddenly the experience will instantly become special because its not going to come again. If it comes good and If it doesn't its also good. Because you are living  a fresh life, fresh moment. every morning is a new morning. Every day is a new day. Where there is new, memory is not needed.

---
Now, if something gives you a bad experience, it doesn't mean its going to be bad every time you interact with it. 
For example: A dog ran and barked at you, you ran and was startled.
Now, you accept that road and that dog as dangerous and you avoid taking that route all together because that dog ran behind you.
Now, It will take immense courage to get at that road, and few re-visits to make you comfortable with that road again.
----
Next Chapter is: If good experience and bad experience is past, why do we chase it, why do we chase pleasure if it happened it the past. Because we know that past is equal to death, because it happened. Whats happening is alive. What happened is dead. Are we that stupid that we are chasing what's dead.

No, we are not stupid we are clever, we have discovered pleasures that can feel the same again for a long time. Till they get exhausted.
