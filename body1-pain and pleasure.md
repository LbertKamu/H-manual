The loop of duality.
1. someone said that we can feel we are alive because we have ups and downs in our life, cheer it. flat line belongs to a dead person.
2. Another man phrased it as and i quote "to live is to suffer and to survive is to find meaning in that suffereing"

 what is a loop, its a circle of death. we are going round and round, stuck into a pattern and one of larger one is the loop of happiness and sadness, the loop of avoiding pain and chasing pleasure. The loop of i like this and i dislike that.
 
 See it in your daily life, we want to control the day but the day is as alive as you are and it has its own momentum and you have to confront that you have no other option. 
 For eg. you choose to rest for the day, you switch off your phone and was planing to sit on your bed and watch movie or sleep or play games. Now, if this will happen or not depend on the day and situation you are in, maybe today your mother need groceries, you relative brother is looking for a college and you have to find it for him, or your girlfriend wants to go out for shopping, or you might get sick because of the food you eat last night, or you wake up with a sharp pain that wont go away and you have to visit the doctor. You can't help it, you have to confront the day now matter what you want with the day. 
 
 "as i was writing this something happende: its winter, and the sun was warm and my mother was cutting the frutis for herself and she thought she should ask me. She screamed from the other room that if i want the fruits, and if yes then ask your brother if he also wants the same."
 I screamd back, that i was writng.
 she said, so, you want it or not, and did you ask you brother if he wants the fruits.
 The momentem was lost so, i choose to take the laptop to her and eat the fruit. I asked my brother if he wants the fruits, he was in a meeting so i left him alone. and i am typing this as i am eating the fruits. 
 you see the day is as alive as me. But if you watch the day closely you will see patterns and a recurring situations you face daily and you can shape the day according to your need.
 I could have said that i am writing dont disturb me. but i am fine with it. I don't care about the interuption because i can write this book anywhere i want, and anytime i want. my likes and dislikes dont bother me much. they are there but on my terms.(fix this text to vague)
 
But i am writing a fiction which requires a flow, a flowing state when ther words are pouring in one after another, you are in a frenzy when you with your pen barely trying chaze whats been woven in you head, and when someone intrupts you. and you see your chain of thought just vanishing before you. it might make you crazy becasue what you are writing is half baked and you dont know where to go, you were going to take this lane but now now matter how hard you think you just have the footprints of the lane but nothing of anything thats worthwhile, its lost and you have to change lane of your story and its frustrating because what you had was wonderful. So, when I write fiction I make sure what my day demands from me, i observe it and found out that early mornigs and late nights have the best few hours that no one can intrupt you. So, i wrote my first story in my room during lockdown when my parents had to go for a month to care for a sick elder. It took me exactly two months to finish the first draft. first month was as i wanted it to be, I would write from morning six to eleven everyday. maybe skipped a few days here and there. And another month where my parents had to be in quarantine for 14 days, these 14 days were aslo the same. But when ter were home the morning were completely destroyed and god know how i was able to finish the first draft, writing sometimes only 15 minutes a day. It was misserible. 

The second story i also wrote during the lockdown, but the days were demanding, the family dynamics was such that their was chaos and in the campus where we live in they opened the library, and i wrote my second story in that library, from 11 am to 2pm. The day will have demands no mater how you try to control your day, it will have something for you. Even if you choose to live alone, you have to deal with the day.

My third story I wrote in a park, because the library was crowded by now and people used to freakout by my amount of frenzy and focus, how I am fliping page after page, stretching wildly, moving around in excitment when trying to imaging a plot and its posibilities. I had to leave.
 

 The loop of duality:
 1. if something happens that you like you are happy. This is pleasure: which in clude all the good sensations and good feelings.
 2. when something happens that you dont like you are sad. this is pain: which include all the discomfort and painfull feeling. which include, sadness, loneliness, boredome, jealousy, envy and so on so on.
 3. naturally we avoid discomfort and run towards the things we like. we chase the pleasure.
 4. example of discomfort that is common for everyone: slap, fever: you are filled with thoughts.
 5. What is discomfort, what is pain, we need to undersatand that because we welcome pleasure.but becasue of pleasure the pain exist. Break the loop and live the fulfilled life you always wanted.
 6. because of pleasure their is pain and because their is pain we are ambitious and we think that acheaving the things we want will fulfil us and fix everything in our life. but people who are where they wanted to be are not fulfilled, the desire to fulfil stays with them till the day they die.
 7. problem with pleasure is that it exhaust over time. because pleasure is not alive and you experiece it in the past. fruit example.
 8. something this is pleasing to your senses right now doesnt mean it will be the same always.
 9. you dont deny pleasure, you just see clearly that the pleasure is happening because of the circumtancces. Same situation that is giving you pleasure right now might left you displeasing in the future. 
 10. pleasure is good when its happening, after that it has no significance. Dont take it with you and compare it with everytime you face the same situation again.
 11. The masterbation to sex story. thank god that we age and as we age we are less sexually aroused.
 12. break the loop of duality and become free, then you will live in the present.
