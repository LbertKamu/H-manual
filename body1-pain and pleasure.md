## The loop of duality.
1. someone said that we can feel we are alive because we have ups and downs in our life, cheer it. flat line belongs to a dead person.
2. Another man phrased it as and i quote "to live is to suffer and to survive is to find meaning in that suffereing"
these two implies that one should exist in the loop of happiness and sadness. you feel happy because you were sad, and you become sad because you were happy. and this loop end with our death.

 Loop is a circle of death. we are going round and round, stuck into a pattern and one of larger one is the loop of happiness and sadness, the loop of avoiding pain and chasing pleasure. The loop of i like this and i dislike that.
 
 

## So, what do we want?
If something happens the way we want we are happy other wise we are sad. Then what is this `want` we are , thing actually, happiness and fulfilment. Happiness and fulfilment are related friends, happiness is something that you get when everthing goes the way you wanted but fulfilment on the other hand is a state where everyday to the end of you life you are happy and satisfid. (holy shit i have a new idea for a movie, what if somehow a character is put into a situation where ther are always happy and they get bored of happiness. 60s bollywood happy life, with the reality of his prison life.) lets look at the second point, when we say we are totally fulfilled and satisfied. Do we mean that, we got everything that we ever wanted, the girl you liked is your wife now, you wanted to travel into space and now you have a space company, you eat fast food, pizza burger, cheese, and all the fatty stuff and you still are healthy, and have six packs, you are the richest person in the world that elon musk is your driver and yet you are able to sleep twelve hours a day. you are running ten sucessfull company yet you are on vacation most of the year travelling the world. You liked another girl and now she is your second wife, for you specially god has send his angles as your maid. for you god has made you imortal and now you can live forever and has babies more the gengis khan could ever produce.

You see the problem, your want has nothing to do with the reaity, what you read above is an adult unemployed male dreaming in the afternoon as he lay listening to a motivationl vidoes on youtube. 

`We want someting because we think that getting what we want will give us happines and fulfillment. We dont want that a random stranger should get the girl you like. you want that girl for yourself because you think that she can provide what you want, her existence in your life will solve all your problem, you are going to have sex with her, you are going to protect her and ect..ect..
and just thinking about it give you pleasure, and you wonder if she really be with you, the world will be perfect for you. yet we see people breaking up. because what they imagined was not true, in reality she doesn't need a man to protect her, and it hurts your ego and you desire to protect her, you are unhappy, She calls you pervert, because all you want is sex, and it made you insecure and your sense of self is hurt, you are unhappy because you are not having the amount of sex you thought you could be doing. see this [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiadiscussion/comments/1hlceuu/lmao_when_prn_sites_replies_are_more_sensible/#lightbox) post. you start a startup but no-one sees the value in your product, and you are sad, right. you are sad because you iamgined that you will run the startup and it will be bigger then facebook, and then you will also write on your buisness card that "I am ceo bitch" but no one is seeing any value in your startup and it is dying and you are sad, but if you knew and you were practical about the things you can manifest in this world then the story is different. To run a company like space x, you need to sell a company like paypal. you go step by step, faliur after faliur when finally you get what you want because you really worked for it. what we want has nothing to with reality we are living in. yet we want becasue we think it will fulfill us and give us the satisfaction we needed to be happy.

## COLLECTING PLEASURE:
look at you life and see if you are anything other then the person who collects pleasure. look at your day from the moment you wake up to the moment you sleep. when you are consumed in pleasure you are ok, but as soon as something which is not pleasure happens you get crazy and you need another pleasure to fill that.
 

 The loop of duality:
 1. if something happens that you like you are happy. This is pleasure: which in clude all the good sensations and good feelings.
 2. when something happens that you dont like you are sad. this is pain: which include all the discomfort and painfull feeling. which include, sadness, loneliness, boredome, jealousy, envy and so on so on.
 3. naturally we avoid discomfort and run towards the things we like. we chase the pleasure.
 4. example of discomfort that is common for everyone: slap, fever: you are filled with thoughts.
 5. What is discomfort, what is pain, we need to undersatand that because we welcome pleasure.but becasue of pleasure the pain exist. Break the loop and live the fulfilled life you always wanted.
 6. because of pleasure their is pain and because their is pain we are ambitious and we think that acheaving the things we want will fulfil us and fix everything in our life. but people who are where they wanted to be are not fulfilled, the desire to fulfil stays with them till the day they die.
 7. problem with pleasure is that it exhaust over time. because pleasure is not alive and you experiece it in the past. fruit example.
 8. something this is pleasing to your senses right now doesnt mean it will be the same always.
 9. you dont deny pleasure, you just see clearly that the pleasure is happening because of the circumtancces. Same situation that is giving you pleasure right now might left you displeasing in the future. 
 10. pleasure is good when its happening, after that it has no significance. Dont take it with you and compare it with everytime you face the same situation again.
 11. The masterbation to sex story. thank god that we age and as we age we are less sexually aroused.
 12. break the loop of duality and become free, then you will live in the present.
