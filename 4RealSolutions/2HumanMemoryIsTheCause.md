The straight forward answer is that the human memory is the cause of human suffering. The ability of having a memory is so grand that if not keep in check it can cause a lot of harm to our system. But to see that the memory is the root cause of every suffering we need to see how using memory we gets to the suffering part.


Map Of Memory.

Memory:- ability to record and collect what's happening around us through five senses. 

Why its needed ?

Its needed to survive, it is needed to live a comfortable life.

How it's needed in survival ?

 When you are walking down a natural path and world is as new as it was when god created it, and you are naked and without memory, walking around in the jungle.
 
 Something ticks in the foot, and you see it and pluck it out with a grunt. (Bad experience). you walk away, A wild dog comes and starts to bark at you, his friends also joins him in barking, now they are barking at you, your heart is racing, you mind is alerting, your legs are shaking. you climb a tree and waited for the dogs to leave. Then as the sunset is about to happen, they left you alone. You jump off the tree and hauls away.(Bad experience)

 You run and run, till you smell sweetness in the air, and you cross the only few bushes to find a magnificent lake. A lake still as you were when god created you. You look at the sunset, and the reflection of sunset in the lake. The sweetness in the air belongs to a tree that was beside you. you are overwhelming by the colors and the whiff of sweetness that the tree was carrying with it. 

 You see a women young as you are; naked as you are, peaking from behind the same tree. you smile at her and something is happening inside you body. your heart is racing, you looked around but no dogs are there, but you soon realize that this heart racing is different from that heart racing. This is making you crazy in a good way, that was making you crazy in a bad way. She comes near you and touches you on your shoulder and hugs you. You feel complete at the moment. The sunset, the smell, the hug.(good experience)

 You reproduce on the same spot and had twins, a girl, and a boy and as they grow up, you won't let them leave the lake because, the outside is dangerous. And because its not dangerous for them they have no memories of the dogs or the splint, they have to believe you and they hate you for that and they dream of the day they can really grow up  and finally able to see the things you have seen, but with there eyes.

Behind the colorful sky, under which you made love, a shadow appeared, it is god, he looked at all this and smiled and turned away and on his ear peace he said "the circus is up and running, my lord"

Analysis of the above text:

If you did't had the memory, given by god. You might get splint a thousand time and you would still be clueless, the dogs would bark at you a thousand time and you would not remember that they could harm you.

 If you didn't had the memory you would not remember the sunset, or that smell, or the naked women, and the love you made and the pleasure you felt and you might never settle there because the memory is not there that you felt good.

But memory is there and your five senses are there and its recording all the time. and it has the collection of bad and good experiences now with this collection of memory, **the ability to compare or in general The ability of pattern matching comes into being.** Like we can see a formation of stars in the night sky, and even if we are far from where we saw it, it is still visible, and it is visible no matter where you choose to settle. you match pattern and point out that this star pattern is visible at night from everywhere. You have the memory of this star formation at four different places, now you have data in your memory and the obvious thing you do is compare and tell people that its visible frow everywhere we go. You name it orion. You also observed that its easily visible in winter but rarely in summer.
Now with the ability of pattern matching and comparing the data we have in our mind. Another ability came into being.
**The ability of anticipation.**
You say this star formation is visible from four different spots, it is possible that it is visible from anywhere I go. 
You are anticipating, its not real, you don't know but you are trying to predict the possibility, and to make sure you need to visit ten more places far far away. 
Now with the ability of anticipation, **The ability to desire is born.**
You wanting to check if what you **anticipated** is true or not. It's the desire in the purest form. I say purest form because desire is anticipation, if you do no anticipate, the desire is not.

these are the basic functions that comes when we have the collection of memories:
 Pattern matching or comparing. Anticipating. desire.

There are more functions, but we will come to them. as I said having memory is grand. What we have to realize is that these functions are there for us to survive. Just survive. Nothing else, We can include technology as we are deep into it. so, these function are really needed in the area of survival and technological world.

You see having memory is a blessing from our creator. Its so potent and grand that if not keep in check it can fuck us up. 

These three function that pops out of memory is on the surface level and easily recognizable.

Another two are there which are behind these three function. pattern matching, anticipating, desire, these three does not happen because you have memory. Its not magic. Having memory is magic but the things that pops out of them are tools. and tools have different functions and we can use them to do things.

So, two main tools that are always there but we don't think about them because, they are always in use. We don't think about them because the tool itself is "thinking" another tool behind thinking is "Thought".

So, what is happening is that Memory happens, means you have good and bad experiences, stored in your brain.

out of which thoughts comes: means the ability to recall the data or the memories that you have collected over time. For example: you look at you girlfriend and you might recall the first kiss you had with her.

Now from the ability of thought (recalling collected memory)born the thinking which modifies the thought. Out of which three of the above mention function are born.

Pattern matching: Its obvious, we use it all the time. It helps us into differentiate between species of birds, trees, cultures and all the thing that look similar or look totally different. 
example:
Suppose you have found a place where the gold is. Now you dig it and use it to get rich. Now you invest money into finding more gold, now you found four more places where the gold is and because your pattern matching skill is there you find pattern that the land and the kind of vegetation and animal or the kind of wether or the type of weed or the distance of the land from the sea is similar among the four land you have discovered. its obvious next step that you anticipate and pick places that are similar to your discovery and you might find gold there.(although in reality finding gold is a random occurrence)

This pattern matching, anticipating, and then desire is working all the time.
