# Basic **MAP** of *Being Human*:

* We have to first realize the fact that our creator haven't born us with anything, but a blank slate who is intelligent enough to figure everything by himself.
*  another fact is you can not be what you are not allowed to be. We as a species became conscious either by mistake, while eating mind expanding mushroom or mating with an advanced alien species that afterwards we grew conscious. Whatever it was, we can not be sure, one thing we are sure of is that we are conscious beings, who can look up and wonder and ask "Who the fuck created us."

 ***`So, we grew conscious, and no one asked us if we ever wanted to be conscious, but we are here.`*** 

 * Then all the history happened, we created language and discovered mysticism, we begin the war, claiming god given land for thyself. Kingdoms slit through glories and decayed through time. Monarchism. Communism. Democracy. CAPITALISM. happened. And we are here in our cubical, in a petty little office, on the verge of suicide, living mechanically, slaving for corporate, screaming for the artificial intelligence. From eating shrooms to creating our own artificial intelligence. How crazy it sounds. Yet this long long progress of mankind flowering to this we still SUFFER, we want to end this life, because we don't find meaning in the current existence, and we end up wondering only if i had the manuel for a human as if how to really function it would be great because of hundreds of self claiming authoritarian who assume authority because they think they know confuses you even further and you find yourself at the end of a rope, inch away from loosing your mind you follow hundred rules given by hundred fools. You add and add to your rules but one thing remains same that you suffer, and thats a **BIG SUFFER.** [This](https://youtu.be/p93w7MpbZRw?t=4) is my one of the favorite dialogue I like from a movie.


## lets come to individual problems.

Remember the third line from top. ` We can not be what we are not allowed`. We need to talk about it more.
* We grew conscious, without our asking, something allowed us to be conscious. *We have no say in it*
* We as an individual born, without our asking. POOF. One day we are born into chaos. *We have no say in it*
* WE DIE, Thats a total fact, we can die any time, I can die while typing this. *We have no say in it*

SO, another fact is that we all are born equally and with a blank slate. You grow up and become something on the thing fed to you by the ideology around. joke alert: if you are an hindu you respect and pray to cow. And seeing that muslims also wanted to respect cow, but hindu wouldnt allow it, so muslims choose to hate pig. they said, you love cow, so we will hate pigs. and then suddenly a britisher came a said, ok hindu loved cow, and muslim hates pig. so what should we do, and then he said it. he said that they will eat both of them. and a chinies man was listing to all the conversation with a cooked lizsard in his mouth. He slurps the tail in. 
you were born blank, and fed shit by the people around you, and we cant be sure when things went shit. but because we all were born blank and we feed eathother shit beacuse everyone is sufferning with something or the other. it means that the system that we feed to newborns are faulty and no one is asking about the faulty system.

so, we were born blank. now let that in. now, if you realise this. we could conclude that our creator made us that way because he was sure that we could figure everything out by ourself.
now, lets begin to negate whatever shit we have gather. its the same shit that we share common,just the the  variation in the intensity makes it hard for enyone to help you, only you can clear your sit by knowing the basic about every shit, so that you can recognise it and negate it.
The moment you think something is shit, the negation always happen by itself.
so,lets go to the next chapter.s



to get to the system of pain and pleasure, sadness and happiness.
