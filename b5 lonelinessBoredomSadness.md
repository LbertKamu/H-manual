What do you do when you are faced with these:

Loneliness, boredom, sadness, dis-satisfaction.

These are the reasons we cry, we want to die, we are miserable. These are also  psychological pain, that you feel deep inside you. But why they are there, and how we avoid them.

1. Ask yourself what you do when you feel lonely, you think about your friends in college how you used to have fun, that carelessness that you miss now, because you have to do a shitty job every day and the dissatisfaction is so heavy on you that the empty night eats you and you think of having a partner even you salary is thirty thousand rupees per month, sure you are thinking of having a life partner, but with that salary you are calling a series of life long suffering to your door step just because we are suffering and are lonely we try to solve it, and create more problem out of it. Instead what if we understand what is loneliness and just eradicate it. That is much easier.

2. Ask yourself what you do when you are sitting in boredom, the activity that used to give you pleasure is not giving it any more, has it happened to you that using instagram doom scrolling become this boring activity that you rest you phone and think about what the fuck you are doing with you life. When you get bore, its because the interesting activities are not interesting anymore and the solution is you collect different pleasure, you try to meditate, you do yoga, go for a run, anything other then the activity that you are used to but after a while when you are fine, you go back to using instagram. Has it happen to you that you exhaust an activity that you don't feel like doing anymore. Listening to you favorite music again and again to the point where you abandon it, its boring now, and you add it to your playlist, among the same songs you were obsessed with, these are the collection of songs you like which you you when you are bored.
so, boredom is simply an activity that doesn't give pleasure anymore. see, for yourself in your life. We all love sunset, but we have to watch it everyday its boring right. But why its boring, if the first time we liked it. we will answer it. I am just explaining the problems now. We have to talk about the problem with solving a problem.

3. Sadness, its the same when things doesn't go according to you you feel sad, and that fine, but as we collect pleasure, life collect sadness for you to create a perfect balance. The loop that we talked about it exist as part of the existence.

4. dis-satisfaction, its also a larger scheme of life, we are dissatisfied with our current life and we are doing things to rid of this dis-satisfaction, looking for another job, looking for passion, majorly we look at the life of a person we admire and we want to be them because we think somehow becoming like him will give us satisfaction. But let me tell you even elon musk take ketamine for his depression and he is the most coolest guy on the planet right now and he says he goes into a negative space and he needs ketamine for that. He will get satisfaction when he will make humans a multi-planetary species. Thats an extreme example, for us, we want to be and banker, a CA, an officer, artist because we have this feeling that there is satisfaction there and you are ready to take as much pain as you can just for that dream. and ones you reach there, you are still dis-satisfied its not like you thought it was and according to the energy you have you choose what to do next, as you choose to stay where you are or you switch to another dream that maybe a computer scientist will satisfy you and you do you phd and become that and still not satisfy. The problem is people who attach satisfaction in a goal will never be satisfy but people who love the process are satisfied most of the time, singers get satisfaction from singing not releasing music. Writers get satisfy from writing not publishing, yes publishing will give immense satisfaction, but nothing compare to writing a new thing or writing a good scene or a poem, the act of creation is always satisfying. A teacher get satisfaction in teaching, a coder in coding. Goals are the byproduct of the life you have chosen, if what you are doing make you famous then its ok but chasing fame and putting you life on hold till you are famous will eat you from inside. People who love the process of anything they do will be satisfied by the process itself.
so, dis-satisfaction is there because you think you are not there where you are supposed to be and its been eating you, and you beat this dis-satisfaction buy doing things that give you instant pleasure, the smoking, the sex, the alcohol, the weed the drugs, entertainment, self amusing, cricket whatever we can collect, you are a marvel fan but a time will come when you will choose to watch the star wars because thats how the mind works.

The, more lonely, the more bore you are the more entertainment, and pleasure you chase. They grow together to a point where you want to leave everything and follow a guru or listening to you parents and limiting yourself into a safe pattern of society, anything that can fucking remove this dis-satisfaction and loneliness, you will listen to anybody and yor are so fragile that people use your suffering to sell you all the rituals and spiritual, sexual, tantric programs, but All you had to do was to understand the cycle or loop of this pleasure and pain.

Now consider this diagram.
Pleasure feels good. Our day revolve around these pleasure and we form a habit to revisit these pleasures everyday because they are safe and we are used to them. But a time will come when these pleasure will not give pleasure because of the repetition we exhaust these pleasure, or a situation make you lost all your current pleasures, like leaving college for a job, leaving one job for another and you have to re-find these pleasure.

`the gap between one pleasure and another is boredom. and a gap between leaving your  one pleasure to another pleasure is loneliness.`

so, input is the life you experience: experience can be good or bad depending on the situation you are facing and how it interacts with your feve senses, if it pleases you then its a good experience, if it dis pleases you then its a bad experience, because day is as alive as you are, it can turn you good experience into bad, and bad experience into good(when you tasted the beer for the first time its was bitter but now you drink it like water without flinching your eyes).
So, because the day has the power to change you good into bad, and bad into good. life becomes unpredictable, and we accept this un predictability and know it exist and to avoid it we find security into different set of pleasures and you depend on them that when these pleasure are not there you get bored and find them,and a time comes when these collected pleasure get exhausted either by over use of changing city or home and you feel lonely till you find different set of pleasure. 
and this constant cycle of pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain, such as loneliness, boredom, ect ect. It grows and grows to a point where you cant take it anymore and you make stupid decision after stupid decision till you find book like these to aid to you life. or you find a fake guru who fuck fix you up a spiritual life. thanks. thats the introduction.
