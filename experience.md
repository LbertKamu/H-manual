lets begin from the begining, from the day we are born.
As we popped out into the world and first thing that happens with us is we experience the existence. All the beep from the monitors and the alien native words, eyes squinting from the tublight, the buzzing electricity in the wires, or the warmth of our mother's comforting voice, everything we experience we experience for the first time. So, Experience is the first thing we should talk about.

### What is experience?
Experience is the data we take from the universe and store somewhere inside us. I.e. We Create memories of the things that happen to us or we encounter.
#### So, have you asked yourself, why on the first place we are recording everything.
The only reason we record things happening around us is to use them in future. 
* May be its a skill.
* May be its the first time you had sex, or first kiss.

There are lot of first's in our life. That is the experience we record.

Experinence involve our five senses and according to our senses we define whats a bad experience and what's a good experience.
**Bad experience:-**
* When you eat or drink something that is bitter that in your experience is bad, we hated cough syrup as a kid, Now, we chug beer as bitter as cough syrup, because at at end of it we are going to fell really really good. We would not touch beer if at the end, it does'nt give the tipsy swrill.
* If you are unfortunate like me, Your father or your mother must have hit you when you were in school, its not pleasing to your senses, you wouldn't opt for it willingly. 


**Good experience**
* So, Sex is the best experience you can have in the daily living. If you have done it, you know you can remember this experience second by second, its so vivid and good. 
* When you eat your favorite food, or pizza that overwhelms your taste buds.
* Sleeping.
* travelling.
* Tea, whiskey, coffee.... and endless things that is a good experience.

Good experience is something that is pleasing to our senses. A bad experience is the opposite, that displeases your senses. 
Now, experience is based on the events that we attend to in our daily living. What's good for someone can be displeasing for the other.
* You might love smoking but there are people who hate it.
* you might love a dog. Other might love a cat.

So, what you call yourself is the bundle of events you experience, that can be bad or that can be so good that You might call it your calling. Something that you like so much that you can do it for the rest of your whole life.

So, we can say that experience is past which is recorded in our mind. Past means the things that happened to us or infront of us.
so, we had sex, or we had pizza for the first time and it was pleasing to our senses in the past, now because it was a good experience we want to have it in the future also we want exactly that exerience that was recorded in the past, the same sensations, the same heartbeat, same breating pattern, same sweetness in our mouth. But sometime we don't get it. That's why we usually say it was good but not the same.

Oh, I love dominos but it's not the same anymore. Catch yourself, when you say this, its not same anymore, you are chasing the same intensity of experience that you experienced in the past.
Even the sunset, in our life time we will see many sunset but we tend to compare every sunset with the one sunset that we loved.
So when we say a person is changed, it simply means that we had similar kind of good experiences so we  were together now that he has found another set of good experience , we are not the same anymore.

Maybe, we both loved smoking and now you quit it and now you are into yoga, But i still smoke so, its about time we are not going to be together. 

To culminate this, we need to define basic terms.
Pain and pleasure:
Pain = bad experience.
Pleasure = good experience.
we avoid pain and we chase pleasure. So, we are chasing good experience and we are avoiding pain that is bad experience. and we know that experience is past.
So, Memory is helping us to know what to avoid and what to chase.
