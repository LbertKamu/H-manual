lets begin from the begining, from the day we are born.
As we popped out into the world and first thing that happens with us is we experience the existence. All the beep from the monitors and the alien native words, eyes squinting from the tublight, the buzzing electricity in the wires, or the warmth of our mother's comforting voice, everything we experience we experience for the first time. So, Experience is the first thing we should talk about.

### What is experience?
Experience is the data we take from the universe and store somewhere inside us. I.e. We Create memories of the things that happen to us or we encounter.
#### So, have you asked yourself, why on the first place we are recording everything.
The only reason we record things happening around us is to use them in future. 
* May be its a skill.
* May be its the first time you had sex, or first kiss.

There are lot of first's in our life. That is the experience we record.

Experinence involve our five senses and according to our senses we define whats a bad experience and what's a good experience.
**Bad experience:-**
* When you eat or drink something that is bitter that in your experience is bad, we hated cough syrup as a kid, Now, we chug beer as bitter as cough syrup, because at at end of it we are going to fell really really good. We would not touch beer if at the end, it does'nt give the tipsy swrill.
* If you are unfortunate like me, Your father or your mother must have hit you when you were in school, its not pleasing to your senses, you wouldn't opt for it willingly. Unless,......There are some who would opt for the hitting, that is also a ugly part of experience that I am fearing to talk about. As i don't want a kid to read this stuff this early, and because its a human manual I have to put it. So, if you are below 18, i advise you to avoid this chunk.

Warning, kid, leave this chunk.
So, Sex is the best experience you can have in the daily living. If you have done it, you know you can remember this experience second by second, its so vivid and good. If feels good for a year and some people depend on it as there only fine moments in there life and the magic of it wears out by them over doing it. So, they choose to knotch it up to get the same experience they used to have. So, they choose to do the sick shit (I know you are reading, you little shit :) ) And as time passes the sick shit takes many extreme form, where getting hit gives more plesure, getting dominated and getting torned by someone else is the only thing that can give utmost pleasure. (Next, chapter we are going to talk about pain and pleasure, everything will make sense, be with me.)

**Good experience** When you eat your favorite food, or pizza that overwhelms your taste buds.
