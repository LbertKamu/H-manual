Inputs are the things that we cant control, but it is still in the realm of pleasing and displeasing of senses---- inputs are the things that that might make a pleasurable situation into painful situation, and painful situation into a pleasure one.
Inputs is the real life you are living. for say you like coffee. and now you are out and you see a coffee shop and you order one and it taste like shit. the experience is bad even though you thought you like coffee. its a bad experience.

thats why they say when life give you lemon you make a lemonade and drink up.

Inputs are also your likes and dislikes but with a twist. Input is the day you face, no matter what your likes and dislikes are, the day will challenge you, you love coffee, the day might feed you a shitty coffee to ruin you. 
The day challenge you, and your struggle to accept the challenge makes you miserable.

## Our daily life.
See it in your daily life, we want to control the day but the day is as alive as you are and it has its own momentum and you have to confront that. you have no other option. you are functioning in a limited loop of happiness and sadness, pain and pleasure, likes and dislikes every day.
 For eg. you choose to rest for the day, you switch off your phone and was planing to sit on your bed and watch movies or sleep or play games. All you want to do today is be free from every shit you have in you life. Now, if yhat you like will happen or not depend on the day and situation you are in, maybe today your mother need groceries, you relative brother is looking for a college and you have to find it for him, or your girlfriend wants to go out for shopping, or you might get sick because of the food you ate last night, or you wake up with a sharp pain that wont go away and you have to visit the doctor and wait in the lobby for hours. You can't help it, you have to confront the day no matter what you want with the day.

Now, you might hate going to the doctor and wait in the lobby for your appointment and you resent you body for doing this to you on a  day where you needed the time for yourself but when you are angry and pissed and was waiting in the lobby and a girl of your age joins you in a conversation and even if you are in pain you are taking and blushing and exchanging numbers. When finally spending the whole day at the hospital and talking to her get to know her you reach home with a smile on your face, a day well spend you say before going to bed.

you should see this in you every day life, you have thinks you like to do, that gives you pleasure and make you happy and then there is the day giving you contradicting inputs that turn you pleasure into pain and pain into pleasure.

If you see this in your daily life, then you might want to ask why does it happen. Why something you like sometimes give you pain and something you don't like sometimes gives you pleasure. We will touch this again in coming chapter first we need to understand few other things.



 "as I was writing this something happened, you can skip it if you want: Its winter, and the sun was warm today and my mother was cutting the fruits for herself and she thought she should ask me. She screamed from the other room that if i want the fruit salad, and if yes then ask my brother if he also wants the same."
 I screamed back, that i was writing.
 she said. so, you want it or not, and did you ask you brother if he wants the salad.
 The momentum of my writing was lost so, I choose to take the laptop to her and eat the salad. I asked my brother if he wants some, he was in a meeting so I left him alone. I am typing this as I am having the fruit salad.

 you see the day is as alive as me. But if you watch the day closely you will see patterns and a recurring situations you face daily and you can shape the day according to your need.
 I could have said that i am writing don't disturb me. but i am fine with it. I don't care about the interruption because I can write this book anywhere I want, and anytime i want. Because i know what i want to write I am just turning them into words.
 
But if am writing a fiction which requires a flow, a flowing state when the words are pouring in one after another, you are in a frenzy when you with your pen barely chasing whats been woven in you head, and when someone interrupts you and you see your chain of thought just vanishes before you. it might make you crazy because what you are writing is half baked and you don't know where to go, you were going to take this lane but now now matter how hard you think you just have the footprints of the lane but nothing of anything thats worthwhile, its lost and you have to change lane of your story and its frustrating because what you had was wonderful. So, when I write fiction I make sure what my day demands from me, i observe it and found out that early mornings and late nights have the best few hours that no one can interrupt me.
 So result of observing my day goes like this, I wrote my first story in my room during lock down when my parents had to go for a month to care for a sick elder. It took me exactly two months to finish the first draft. first month was as I wanted it to be, I would write from morning six to eleven everyday. maybe skipped a few days here and there. And another month where my parents had to be in quarantine for 14 days, these 14 days were also the same. But when they were home the morning were completely destroyed and god know how i was able to finish the first draft, writing sometimes only 15 minutes a day. It was miserable.

The second story i also wrote during the lock down, but the days were demanding, the family dynamics was such that their was chaos and in the campus where we live in they opened the library, and i wrote my second story in that library, from 11 am to 2pm. The day will have demands no mater how you try to control your day, it will have something for you. Even if you choose to live alone, you have to deal with the day.

My third story I wrote in a park, because the library was crowded by now and people were freaking out by the amount of frenzy and focus I put into writing, how I was flipping page after page, stretching wildly, moving around in excitement when trying to imaging a plot and its possibilities. I had to leave.

The amount of struggle i have to put just to get a secluded place to myself is just because the day is as alive as i am, and it demands a lot, no matter who you are. even when I had managed to get the secluded writing place, there were many interruption.

So, when something happens the way we want it to happen we are happy for that day. and when nothing happen the way we want, we are miserable.

lets recap: 
Input is the life that you are living and facing everyday situation. 
Inputs might make you pleasure into pain and might turn you pain into pleasure, We have no control over the inputs we get from the day or the daily living.
Input challenges you likes and dislikes, your pain and pleasure and just reverse them.
