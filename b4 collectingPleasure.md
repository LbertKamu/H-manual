## collecting pleasure:

No matter what we like, want or desire for ourself unpredictability of life will always be there no-matter what you do, and secretly we accept that unpredictability  thats why we collect pleasure to avoid that unpredictability, from the point we wake up to the point we sleep. we have safe, and comforting pleasures that we go to, lets look at some daily life related examples.

1. Why do we watch a show or a movie while eating lunch or diner.
2. why do we need to take the mobile phone into the loo.
3. Why do we need a earphone and some personal sorted music to listen to while traveling in metro or a cab. 
4. Why do we need to smoke a cigarette when waiting for someone to meet.
5. Why do we need to blast the music just to take a bath.
6. why do we need to read thirty minutes before sleeping.
7. Why do we escape the reality we live in through entertainment and self amusement.
8. Why are we so obsessed with sex.
9. Why do we need to wear that same hoodie again and again.

Why you like physics and you friend like chemistry, its a personal preference maybe initially your introduction with physics was so awesome that you love it.

 For me it was when I in my physics lab and section-A class was just ended and at my sitting place There was this magnet placed near the iron sand. I played it for a while not listening to what the teacher was saying, I pored some iron sand on my open notebook and placed the magnet over it and it made this beautiful pattern, that magnetic field make I was blown away I looked up in wonder, what the fuck was that and then i looked at my teacher he grabbed the wooden window and swinged it to shut and before doing so he asked us to observe all the other windows and the main gate and I did and when he swinged it all the other gates and window just moved after it. It was fascinating. He called it a pascal law. I made my interest in the physics but then i was weak in chemistry and maths so, nothing happened with physics.

 Same with your friend who love chemistry, maybe he seen something fascinating regarding chemistry that he like it so much.

 Now, we make friends based on similar interest and pleasures like you are friends with the chemistry guy just because you share the similar loath for maths and through that similar loathing for maths you are friend and when you find a guy who loves maths you both call him nerd for liking maths. But he is also in the same boat as you, his introduction with maths was so fascinating that he loves math.

 No matter what the object is behind it there is pleasure, object changes, interest changes not the pleasure.

 For example, you were a smoker and had smoker friends. Now you are not a smoker, you have quit but your friends didn't you will soon replace them because now your pleasure lies in breathing fresh air and respecting your body. and their in the smoking. Now that your object is different, you will have different set of friends. 

 Thats why as you grow, you loose friend and make new ones. One thing never change that we collect pleasure, and change them as we grow.

 Everything about our day is about pleasure or about avoiding pain. The moment pain arise you want to solve them without looking and staying with the problem ad you stay with pleasure.

 so, its a loop. every day is a loop till the day you die. In every day you do all the activity that you feel interesting and that which gives you pleasure and when pain appears you avoid it as quickly as possible. So, your day become this pleasure chasing and pain avoiding mechanism.

 But if you hate your job that you spent the most time, you think about pleasure, you plan the weekend trip in you cubical, you flirt with you friend and many more thing you do in yours office just to keep it together.

 Or maybe you are so discontent with you life that you live to drink and smoke.

 No, matter the situation you are stuck in you have your little and big pleasure around you that you think keep you sane. They keep you together. 

 First we should see that we are in a loop of chasing pleasure and avoiding pain.
 seeing this will lighten you for sure, that really you are chasing pleasure and avoiding pain. you watch tv while having the food because it uplifts the eating experience.

 You travel in metro and listen to music because you can spent forty minutes with yourself and music just makes this little journey interesting.

 Next, loneliness, boredom, sadness.





1. The day is not going in your favour, you watch your comfort movie that is there for this exact situation when you loose the grip on the day, i forget the ice cream tub, obviously sugar free.
