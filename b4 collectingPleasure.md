## collecting pleasure:

No matter what we like, want or desire for ourself unpredictability of life will always be there no-matter what you do, and secretly we accept that thats why we collect pleasure to avoid that unpredictability, from the point you wake up to the point you sleep. you have safe, and comforting pleasures that you chase. 

1. The day is not going in your favour, you watch your comfort movie that is there for this exact situation when you loose the grip on the day, i forget the ice cream tub, obviously sugar free.
