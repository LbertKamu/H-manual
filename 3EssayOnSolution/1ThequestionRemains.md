Ok Lbert(this is me, the writer), you fed us so many terms and words. You showed us that, yes we chase pleasure every day however small or however big, It doesn't matter. We also use pleasure to avoid pain, and we know that the life is unpredictable and can turn your pleasure into pain, or pain into pleasure and to deal with that unpredictability we try to find security in the things that can give us pleasure in long term and short term, and we also see that the gap between one pleasure to another pleasure, their is boredom, even before finishing an activity we think about what's next and If we wait we feel bored; Same with loneliness when we lose great pleasure we feel lonely. Our girlfriend, boyfriend or thing dumped us and he, she, they use to give us immense pleasure, their smile, sex, the way they talk ect,ect, and they are not there and I feel lonely.

 We see that, But what about it, because pleasure feel good and we can't just drop it. We want pleasure. What kind of a life will it be, if you can't enjoy the things that gives immense pleasure.

I hope I have put the most logical question rightly.
