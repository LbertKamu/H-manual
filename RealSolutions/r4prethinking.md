## Now the second tool is "Thinking"

Thinking is the process that happens when Thought happens. You look at tree and all the memories related to trees triggers. Then thinking begins, which is pattern matching(comapprison), Anticipation, desire. Thought is normal part of our being. It should trigger when needed. you look at you mom and if thought doesn't trigger you will not recognize that its your mother.

But when thought triggers, the process of thinking begins. If thought is not then thinking is not.
So, if you see this that when any object interacts with your five senses, memories related to that object triggers, and then only thinking takes over. 

So, you see that the ability of having a memory(good experience and bad experiences) and the thought born out of it(ability to recall the memories) is not directly responsible for all the suffering but if they are not suffering is not. 

But we have them with us to keep us alive, thank god. So, memories and thought are not directly responsible but thinking part is where the real life issues that starts to brew.
Let me solve everything for you in a sentence. When your five senses interacted with all the objects in the world, be it a person, a non living thing, a terr, a cloud, or an ant. or any fucking one and any fucking thing. If you have memories related to any of that it will trigger. and after the memories trigger, then only thinking will come.
So, the solution is to naturally develop the ability to look at an object and when the memories trigger if you want to use it you use otherwise dump it. We don't even have to deal with the thinking part. because its a by product of thought.
This is what being a conscious being is.

This is the only solution, you can try it now, look around yourself and see what triggers your memories. Its easy to observe when life is good, but its equally had when you are deep into shit, and the courage is needed to reject all your problems no matter how big they are.
You try this solution, If we teach this to our kids in preschool, there life would be effortless. But now you are big and stuck in the woven illusion of the mankind, Its not so easy for you but its possible because you have more ability then a preschool kid. 

Buckle up bitches, lets jump into the know abyss and rip it apart. 
Lets dig the thinking and all the crazy thing springs from it.
