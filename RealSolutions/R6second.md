so the basic process of thinking is: Patter matchin(comparing), anticipating, desire. That is always activated while we are awake. 

Another process of thinking is translation.(We have trained our mind to do this, we created language to communicate and now we live through translation and the real world is lost behind these words, Its crazy how world and words looks similar but are totally different)

Another process of thinking is Image making. the basics of thinking is used in these language and image making process.

## So, the process of image making 

To understand what is this image making we need to see how it manifest in our life. 

The craziest thing that springs from image making is talking to people in your head.

Don't get scared, its fine every person do it, unless one see that is not needed really.

so, the person we have a problem with for example our  father, mother, friend, girlfriend, ect ect... we criticize them in our head and that criticism goes on for a long time or for few minutes depending upon how much you hate or dislike that person. 

What is happening mostly in thinking is that you are talking to someone either an individual or the crowd or on a tv show talking to a host, or having an heated argument, when it comes to thinking you are talking to someone in your head.

that someone is the image you have created about the person, and you are talking to him or her in your head, either for criticism or appriciation or anything., When you are using the language in you head, you are talking to someone. or talking to a crowd.

example. My mother has a habit that she put greasy utensils with the regular dishes in the sink and it makes it hard to clean the regular dishes because they also get smear with the grease and it needs extra efforts to clean them.
so, the conversation goes like this in my head.

mother! how many times do I have to tell you that keep the greasy utensils away from the regular dishes, don't put them in the sink.

Then my other thought will come up and will answer for my mother.

Ok, but who asked you to enter the kitchen. I can wash the dishes myself.

Then my another thought would spring.

You are not well and I am trying to help you a bit, please be considerate and don't make this work more hard then it should have.

Did I ask you for any help, why are you helping. If you can't do it. Don't enter the kitchen.

You will say all the wrong things, but couldn't say that I will keep this in mind.

ok, I will keep this in mind, happy. Now go away.

No, say like you mean it. you stupid women.

Then the mind will do and blurt out all the things you want to say to her, how mean and a bad person she is and it will somehow satisfy you.

Yet you are still washing utensils and getting angry in your head.

see, for yourself how many people you talk to in you head, in the form of critisism.

A trick to check this is to see who are the people you can't criticise because it will make your life hell, be it a boss, mother in law, father, mother, or any authority.

if you see yourself talking or criticising anyone in you head. The reply the person is giving is given by the image you have created about them.

this image making is the process of collecting data related to a person or a group or anything you interact with.

you have to see this in your life, the major part of thinking is you talking to someone or a crowd in you head. it is only possible because you have an image about the crowd or the individual.

Now, to discover these images, you have to do the digging, for yourself.

moving forward:
this process produces the lions are dangerous 






Mix of these basic process fucks you in different way. 

If you pursue pleasure then pain will inavetely follow you. 
if you pursue happiness, the sadness will follow you.
loneliness and boredom. will born out of this. 
desire and dis satisfaction. ambition and faliurs, insecurity. one is there because of the other. Loops. 
the whole process is curropt and it takes a conscious being to see this. and step out of it. a conscious being doesn't deny pleasure, but he won't pursue it. Not because its a rule, but because you see the process chasing pleasure and the things that springs from them.

lets list all the words that comes from suffering and point out which process of memory it is springing from
