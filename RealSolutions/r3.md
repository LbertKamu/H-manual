Two tools of memory that are always there.
1. thought 
2. Thinking


## Thought:
The ability to recall the already collected memory is called thought. 

Q. How do we recall it ?

When you see someone after a long time and you try to recall their name. How you make connections, trying to remember all the memories with that person, you can feel you brain frying, all the neurons trying to grab grab on to each other, you are sweating and panicking. If your neurons are able to make the connections, you might remember their names. but if you can't, you can ask them, why are you panicking.(laugh emoji). 

The situation above is common among us. We forget if we don't met, the people we used to know. And the connection related to that person also weakened.

Q. What connection. What the fuck, what are you talking about, where the suffering part is ?

Yes, I am explaining it. We will get to the suffering part, Its important for you to know that. As I said memory is the culprit. so, I am getting to the suffering part. this is deeper then you think. Don't ask questions please. just read.

So, what connection. Why we forget the name of a person that we haven't seen in years.

Thats how thought works.

## So, lets bring in the real world where thought function. 

Lets talk about bees.
1. they are yellow and black. 
2. They have a sting and if they sting its swells and burns.
3. The live in a hive and their is a queen inside popping more kids to collect more sweetness from different flowers so that they can vomit on their hive. After they have enough vomit. We collect their hive and juice it for that vomit that we call honey. 
4. We drink it, and its awesome.
5. For some reasons Bears love it.

We know bees. Right. We see them now and then. You might have bitten by it. Its perfectly normal.

This above is what thought is. It associate visuals, verbal, textual information with the respected object.

For now we have bees. so, when we look at bees our brain make connection and start to gather all the information related to the bees. It doesn't matter if you have seen it in a movie, or a real life or in books or you have personally seen a bee vomiting honey. Whatever it is, thought's work is to associate as much information as possible to the object of interest. 

So, in our life their are a million objects and all the objects have different associations. 
so, when you wake up, you associate instantly. You look at your laptop and all the info related to pending work comes in you mind. 
You can't sit with yourself so, you have associated using your phone whenever you realize you can't sit with yourself.

You hear you mother's voice or your wife voice, all the relevant memories or information related to them blooms in your mind.

You look for yourself, thought is like that, It activates when it touches something it knows.
