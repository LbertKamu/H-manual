We learned in the last chapter that `Experience` is something that we take from the outer world through our `five senses`.   
If an Experience is discomforting for the five sense it is call pain which comes in different form like, foul smell, foul taste, bad touch, inhuman happenings that we can't bare to see.  
If an Experience is comforting for our five senses then its called pleasure. Which comes in different form like good smell, good taste, intimacy, pleasing views like sunset, a flower, or a furry cat, ect.

## lets go deeper.

#### What is pleasure and pain ?

pleasure is when something that feels good, pain is something that feel worse or bad. Now, there is the intensity of both pain and pleasure.
little pleasure - A quick nap, a cup of tea, yawning, sneezing, farting, burping, laughing, smiling, closing your eyes when they are tired, scratching the mosquito bite. these are little pleasure.
little pain: your muscle ache, common cold, head ache, office meetings, cold water in the winter, hot water in the summer ect ect.

Then on the other side.
big pleasure: pursuing you passion, sex, money, traveling, festivals, buying your dream car ect ect. anything that give you immense satisfaction and feeling of fulfillment is pleasure.

Big pain: Loosing a closed family member, accidents, mental illness, failed ambition, loosing possessions like car, bike, mobile phone, distrustful friends.and many more things that can left you melancholic, sad, depressed are all a part of psychological and physical pain. 

When you introduce yourself to anybody you are mostly talking about what give you pleasure like you are a writer and your favorite writers are albert camus, charlie kaufman, paul thomas anderson, ect ect.  
you are a physicist and your most of the time goes thinking about the nature of matter.
You are a mathematician and your interests are finding the patterns across the universe through calculus.

These are the pleasure that make you pursue them for your whole life, just because something happened in your life that inflicted that interest in you. That is why you are an actor, a scientist, a musician, a business man, a teacher, a hacker, a rebel, a soldier, a politician.

## Pleasure is constant no matter what kind of life you choose?

If you choose a job that deeply interest you, like a teacher, a musician, a singer, a physicist, a founder, a traveler anything that fulfils you. Then the friction in your life will be like a butter, you will slide through it living a meaning full life for yourself. Like these people: [Andrej karpathy](https://karpathy.ai), [Werner herzog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Herzog), [Charles Bukowski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bukowski#Biography). They did or do what they love or loved and nothing else mattered, neither the money nor the fame, yet they are living the most fulfilled life one can live in this capitalistic society. If you have found your interest then sky is the limit. Some found there interest through accident some through a journey of ups and downs.

If you choose a job, any job because you have no interests and you need money to survive, that's  going to be a sad life because then as I said pleasure is constant, you will use that money for pleasure.Like going to movies on weekend, Drinking alcohol at the bar, and on a long weekend going on a trip with the friends, living and enjoying life on weekends, loathing the boss and managers your whole life, and if you are good at what you do, no mater how you hate it, you will get promoted and life will ease down as you age, but because you are living on the weekdays, and hating the rest of the five days, it will take the toll on your body and mind and then the hospital charges. Never asking yourself the question as why i have no interest in life, because if you look around everything in this existence that is created by god is worth exploring. Ask yourself why you have no interests. For example, the person you know, who criticize authority or bad mouth any work related stuff is perfect for this description because they are aware of there pain and still choose to suffer to avoid bigger pain that comes with the unpredictability of life.
I hope they read this book, because here we are going to tackle the pain, the fear, and all the things that cause suffering. Everything will make sense.

There is another life that one can choose but its not worth it to talk about it here, most people comes under the above two description, and the third one will be the obvious one, it will anyway happen once you understand the thing I am talking about.

so, recap: we live our life through five senses. 
If a situation pleases our senses then its pleasure other wise its pain or neutral. Pleasing and displeasing of our senses in a given situation is called experience.
Bad experience means pain. Good experience means pleasure.
Pain and pleasure exist in various intensity. little pain and pleasure or big pain and pleasure.
Pleasure is constant in our life no matter the life we choose, because naturally we want pleasure because it feel good and we avoid pain because it naturally feels uncomfortable.
