## How many time do we have to introduce ourself?
Every time we have to introduce ourself, their is minor panic. What am I supposed to tell them. You have faced it so many time that you have tricks. You only tell what is relevant for the person asking. Thats why we have totally different personality in-front of different set of people, and we switch our personality so effortlessly that we don't even notice. We are different in-front of our parents and different in the place we work, and totally different in-front of our friends, but the question remains who we really are?

### When we introduce ourself, what do we say, what we are?
* Maybe you describe what job you do, or what you are studying.
* What food you like, what food you hate.
* What you like and don't like.
* What culture you belong to. ect.. ect..

So, if we look closely, we born into a religious or non-religious family that impacts what we are going to like and dislikes, and as we grow we discard what doesn't make sense and accept what make sense to ourself, and throughout our life our likes and dislikes changes with time; When our friends tell us we are not the same anymore, or a family member who you use to vibe with few years back brings you a sweet you liked, but now you don't take added sugar because it has harmful effect on your body. You have changed. Right. Does it make sense to you.
  
We also have to accept that our older versions still exist in the mind of different people that we have met in the past, and thats because we had changed something about our personality that is not in line with the person we were friend's with, so naturally, we change people in our life according to the rate we change ourself.
## So what are we changing in ourself ?
There are some constants that we are chasing in our life.
0. Money
1. happiness.
2. health. 
3. Beauty. 
4. fulfillment. 
5. And if you are delusional like me then Enlightenment.

Now, we are all the same wanting exactly this, but we are at a different spot on the marathon of life. Suppose, all the people on this planet are running a marathon called Marathon of life and the finish line is a lot of money, and peak of happiness, peak of health, beauty, fulfillment. Some are winning in the front, full of happiness, health, beauty, fulfillment and money, and some are tired and taking rest, and some quit because they cant take it anymore.

See for yourself where do you stand in the marathon of life. Most people are in the suffering zone, they are in the marathon of life barely surviving, barely running, crying, they don't even take rest for some reason, but they are running.
Your heroes in life are doing better the you and you want to be them. You want to have what they have, and what they have is better health, greater success, greater happiness, even if they are suffering they sure show the image of being someone you want to be.

So, where are you in the marathon of life. Think about it.
> So our personality is defined on the basis of how much health, happiness and fulfillment we could live with and work with.

### Example:
1. Are you someone who workout for for an hour everyday. (A normal living human)
2. Are you someone who think about working out,but do nothing.(A person who is struggling in life)
3. Are you someone who workout seven hours a day.(you are in some sports or crazy)

A set of traits can reveal about you so much.

Now let me show you a dream, what if you don't have likes and dislikes and you could be anyone, and anything and you could do anything that is required for you. You don't judge you don't reject anything or accept anything. It means you have a free personalty, you are what situation needs from you. The usual resistance is not their. The life become effortless, and you are not in the marathon of life, you are life who know what needs to be done and its done.
For say, Its not about if you like to workout or not its about you realizing that your body needs it and their is no friction in doing the activity.

In this book we are trying to get to that, where we can be free from everything.
and the key to that lies in Knowing how a human being function, we can do anything that humanly possible if it is required. Life is like pissing, you gotta do it and you want to do it, we don't ask question wether we should piss or not, we don't even think about pissing, we just do it. 

Lets, now jump right in how a human being function. it took us 1000 years to understand light but we are.
