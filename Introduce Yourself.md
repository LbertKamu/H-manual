How many time do we have to introduce ourself, and everytime we have to introduce ourself, their is minor panic. What am i supposed to tell them, or you have faced it so many time that you have tricks. You only tell what is relevant for the person asking. Thats why we have totally different personality infront of different set of people, and we switch our personality so effortlessly that we dont even notice. We are different infront of our parents and different in the place we work, and totally different infront of our friends.
When we introduce ourself, what do we say, what we are?
* Maybe you describe what job you do. Or what are you studying.
* What food you like, what food you hate.
* What culture we belong to.

So if we look closely, we are the combination of the likes and dislikes according to the cultur or religion we accept. We born into a religious or non-religious family that impacts what we are going to like and dislikes; and as we grow we discard what doesnt make sense and accpet what make sense to ourself, and throughout our life the likes and dislikes changes when our friends tell us you are not the same anymore. Or a family member who you use to vibe with fewyears back brings you a sweet you liked, but now you don't taka added sugar because it has harmful effect on your body. 
We also have to accept that our older versions still exist in the mind of different people that we have met in the past, and thats because we had changed something about our personality that is not in line with the person we are friend's with, so naturally we change people in our life according to the rate we change ourself.
## So what are we changing in ourself..
There are some constant that we are chasing in our life.
1. happiness. 2. health. 3. Beauty. 4. fulfilment. 
5. And if you are dellusional like me then Enlightment.

Now, we are all same wanting exactly this but at a different spot on the marothon of life, some are aceing in the front and some are tired and taking the rest and some quit because they cant take it anymore.
See for yourself where do you stand in the marathon of life. Most people are in the suffering zone, they are in the marathon of life barely surving, barely runing, crying, they cant even take rest but they are running.
Your heros in life are doing better the you and you want to be them. You want to have what they have, and what they have is better health, greater sucess, greater happiness, even if they are suffering they sure show the image of being someone you want to be.

So, where are you in the marathon of life. Think about it.
> So our personality is defined on the basis of how much health, happiness and fulfilment we could live with and work with.  

example:
1. Are you someone who workout for for an hour everyday. (A normal living human)
2. Are you someone who think about working out,but do nothing.(A person who is struggling in life)
3. Are you someone who workout seven hours a day.(you are in some sports)

A set of traits can reveal about you so much.
Now let me show you a dream, what if you dont have likes and dislikes and you could be anyone, and anything. You dont judge you dont reject anything or accept anything. It means you have a freepersonalty, you are what situation needs from you. The usual resistance is not ther. the life become effortless.

In this book are are trying to get to that, where we can be free from everything.
and believe me, knowing how a human being function, we can do anything that humanly possible.
Lets move to the next chapter. maybe we are going to begin exploring what human being is.
